# SaaS Disruption Intelligence

**The Shift:** AI agents are killing traditional SaaS. The opportunity window is now.

**Your Edge:** Understanding this transition deeply enough to build in the gap.

## The Core Thesis

**Old Model (SaaS):**
- User logs into app
- Manually performs tasks
- Pays per seat/month
- Churn when team changes

**New Model (Agents):**
- Agent integrates into workflow
- Performs tasks autonomously
- Pays per outcome/value
- Stickiness through results, not UI

**The Kill Zone:**
Every SaaS that:
- Requires manual data entry
- Has repetitive workflows
- Charges for access not outcomes
- Doesn't own the business result

**The Opportunity:**
Replace SaaS workflows with agentic systems that:
- Work in background
- Deliver business outcomes
- Price on value created
- Are harder to rip out than traditional software

## What You Need to Understand Deeply

### 1. The Technical Shift
- **From:** CRUD apps, dashboards, forms
- **To:** Agent orchestration, tool use, eval frameworks
- **Why it matters:** Technical moats move from "feature depth" to "agent reliability"

### 2. The Business Model Shift  
- **From:** Per-seat SaaS ($50-200/user/month)
- **To:** Outcome-based pricing ($X per result, % of value created)
- **Why it matters:** Better alignment, harder to churn, higher margins possible

### 3. The Value Chain Shift
- **From:** Software enables work
- **To:** Software does work
- **Why it matters:** You capture labor budget, not software budget

### 4. The Moat Shift
- **From:** Features, integrations, data lock-in
- **To:** Workflow understanding, reliability, human-in-loop trust
- **Why it matters:** Different defensive strategies

## Intelligence Gathering

### What to Track (Not Who)

**Technical Signals:**
- New agent frameworks (not just wrappers)
- Evaluation/monitoring tools (reliability is the bottleneck)
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Tool use standards (MCP, etc.)

**Business Signals:**
- SaaS companies adding "AI features" (desperate moves)
- SMBs complaining about SaaS bloat (ripe for replacement)
- Pricing model experiments in AI tools
- Funded agent startups (validation of opportunities)

**Timing Signals:**
- Model capability jumps (what's newly possible)
- Cost drops (what's newly economical)
- Regulatory shifts (what's newly allowed/required)

### Sources

**Technical:**
- ArXiv (agent papers, not just LLM research)
- GitHub (agent frameworks, not example repos)
- HN /show (real products being built)
- AI engineering conferences/talks

**Business:**
- SMB forums (what are they actually struggling with)
- SaaS earnings calls (where are they vulnerable)
- Agency communities (what are they selling)
- YC batches (what's being funded)

**Operators:**
- Not gurus, but people shipping agent systems
- Founders in the space
- Engineers at AI companies
- Consultants seeing demand

## Deep Analysis Framework

For each signal, extract:

### 1. The Capability Unlock
What can now be done that couldn't before?
- New model capability?
- New tooling?
- Cost reduction?
- Reliability improvement?

### 2. The SaaS Vulnerability
Which existing tool/category is now obsolete?
- What workflow does it replace?
- Why is agent version better?
- Who pays for this now?

### 3. The Business Model
How does the agent version make money?
- Who pays?
- What do they pay for?
- How is it priced?
- What's the ROI story?

### 4. The Build vs Buy Decision
Should you:
- Build this yourself?
- Use someone else's platform?
- Partner?
- Ignore?

### 5. The Timing Window
- How long until this is commoditized?
- What's the first-mover advantage?
- What's the sustainable moat?

### 6. The Execution Path
If you were to build this:
- Week 1: What do you ship?
- Month 1: What proves demand?
- Month 3: What proves business model?
- Month 6: What's the sustainable advantage?

## Your Specific Position

**Current:** Pre-revenue, learning, warehouse job
**Goal:** AI agency for SMBs, exit 9-5 in 12 months
**Focus:** Home services → agentic lead capture/scheduling

**The Question This System Answers:**
> "Given the SaaS→agent disruption, what's the highest-leverage thing to build/learn/sell right now?"

**Output:**
Not generic monitoring. Specific analysis of:
- What capability just unlocked
- What SaaS it's replacing  
- How to capture value in that gap
- Exact next steps for you

## Success Metrics

1. **Understanding depth:** Can explain the shift to a SaaS founder and have them agree
2. **Opportunity identification:** Find 1-2 specific SaaS categories ripe for agent replacement per month
3. **Execution validation:** Build/prototype at least one agent system per quarter
4. **Business traction:** Convert understanding into paid work or products

## Anti-Goals

- ❌ Not a news aggregator
- ❌ Not generic "AI trends" tracking
- ❌ Not framework-building
- ❌ Not learning for learning's sake

**Focus:** Deep understanding of the **business and technical mechanics** of the SaaS→agent transition, specifically as it creates opportunities for you to build and sell.
