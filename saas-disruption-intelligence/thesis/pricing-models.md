# Pricing Model Shift: SaaS to Agents

## The Old Model (SaaS)

**Per-Seat Pricing:**
- $50-200/user/month
- Pays for access to software
- Churn when team changes
- Price anchored to "software budget"

**Why It Worked:**
- Clear value metric (seats = usage)
- Predictable revenue
- Sales understood it
- Procurement expects it

**Why It's Dying:**
- Agents don't need "seats" — they work in background
- Value is in outcomes, not access
- SMBs don't have "software budget" for agents
- Hard to justify when AI is "cheap"

## The New Models (Agents)

### Model 1: Outcome-Based

**How it works:**
- Pay per result delivered
- Examples: $50 per booked appointment, $10 per qualified lead

**When to use:**
- Clear, measurable outcome
- High value per outcome
- Customer has budget for that outcome

**Examples:**
- Lead capture: $X per captured lead
- Scheduling: $X per booked appointment
- Support: $X per resolved ticket

**Your Home Services Angle:**
"Capture $15K/month in leads you're missing. We charge $1,500/month."
- ROI is clear: 10x return
- Price is noise compared to value
- Easy to justify

---

### Model 2: Value Capture

**How it works:**
- Take % of value created
- Examples: 10% of revenue attributed to agent, % of cost savings

**When to use:**
- High-value outcomes
- Can measure attribution
- Customer trusts you

**Examples:**
- Sales agent: % of deals closed
- Cost reduction: % of savings

**Risk:**
- Attribution disputes
- Requires trust
- Complex to measure

---

### Model 3: Hybrid (Base + Usage)

**How it works:**
- Base fee for setup/operation
- Usage fee for outcomes
- Examples: $500/month base + $5 per action

**When to use:**
- Need predictable revenue
- Usage varies significantly
- Customer wants to control costs

**Your Home Services Angle:**
$500/month base + $10 per captured lead
- Predictable minimum
- Scales with their success
- Aligns incentives

---

### Model 4: Success Fee

**How it works:**
- Free/low cost to start
- Pay when successful outcome achieved
- Examples: Free pilot, pay only if leads convert

**When to use:**
- New category (hard to sell)
- High trust required
- Can prove value quickly

**Risk:**
- Free riders
- Cash flow issues
- Attribution challenges

## Strategic Implications

### 1. Anchor to Value, Not Cost

❌ "AI voice agent: $1,500/month"  
✅ "Lead recovery system: $1,500/month to capture $15K+ in revenue"

The price is the same. The framing changes everything.

### 2. Avoid Per-Seat Comparisons

Don't let customers compare to:
- Virtual assistant: $2,000/month
- Answering service: $500/month
- Additional employee: $4,000/month

Compare to:
- Missed leads: $20K/month lost
- Your time: $5K/month value
- Competitors capturing those leads: Priceless

### 3. Start with Success Fee, Move to Subscription

**Month 1-2:** Success fee (prove it works)  
**Month 3+:** Subscription (now they can't live without it)

This de-risks for both parties.

### 4. Build in Expansion Revenue

Start simple, add capabilities:
- Month 1: Call answering only
- Month 3: Add scheduling
- Month 6: Add follow-ups
- Month 9: Add reviews

Each expansion = more value = price increase justified.

## Market Timing

**Now (2024-2025):**
- Early adopters will pay premium for outcomes
- Less price sensitivity
- Room to experiment

**Soon (2025-2026):**
- Category matures
- Price pressure increases
