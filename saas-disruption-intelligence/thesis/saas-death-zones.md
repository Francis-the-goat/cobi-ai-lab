# SaaS Death Zones

Categories of software that agents will replace entirely within 24 months.

---

## Zone 1: Form-Based Data Entry

**What:** Tools requiring humans to manually input structured data

**Examples:** CRM entry, expense reports, timesheets, inventory updates

**Why Agents Kill This:**
- Extract from emails, calls, documents automatically
- No UI needed — works in background
- Captures data at source (less error)
- Cheaper than human data entry

**Your Opportunity:** Agents that listen to calls → auto-update CRM, read receipts → auto-categorize expenses

**Timing:** Now. GPT-4V parses docs. Whisper transcribes. APIs exist.

---

## Zone 2: Approval Workflows

**What:** Tools routing work through human approval chains

**Examples:** Purchase approvals, content approvals, PTO requests, invoice approvals

**Why Agents Kill This:**
- 80% of approvals are rubber stamps (agent pre-approves)
- Surfaces exceptions only (10x efficiency)
- Natural language replaces forms

**Timing:** 6-12 months. Needs reliable decision-making.

---

## Zone 3: Simple Scheduling

**What:** Finding times, booking meetings, basic coordination

**Examples:** Calendly, room booking, shift scheduling

**Why Agents Kill This:**
- Negotiate via email/chat (no separate UI)
- Understand constraints ("only mornings, except Tuesdays")
- Handle rescheduling automatically

**Your Opportunity:** Voice-first scheduling for home services

**Timing:** Now for simple. 12 months for complex multi-party.

---

## Zone 4: First-Line Support

**What:** Help desk, FAQ bots, basic troubleshooting

**Why Agents Kill This:**
- Can actually solve problems (not just deflect)
- Access to knowledge base + can take actions
- 24/7, instant, personalized

**Critical:** Must resolve, not just respond.

**Timing:** Now for simple. 6-12 months for complex.

---

## Zone 5: Report Generation

**What:** Tools requiring humans to pull data, create reports

**Why Agents Kill This:**
- Natural language → instant analysis
- Proactive insights with explanations
- Automated distribution

**Timing:** 6-18 months. Needs reliable data analysis.

---

## Zone 6: Simple Content Creation

**What:** Templated, formulaic content

**Warning:** Commoditizing fast. Hard to differentiate.

**Timing:** Now, but crowded.

## Your Focus: Home Services

| SaaS Tool | Agent Replacement | Your Opportunity |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| ServiceTitan | AI booking via conversation | ✅ Core |
| Jobber | Auto-update CRM from calls | ✅ Expansion |
| Housecall Pro | Handle follow-ups | ✅ Add-on |
| Answering services | AI voice agent 24/7 | ✅ Entry |

**Why Home Services:**
- Owners not tech-savvy (won't learn complex SaaS)
- Time-constrained (on jobs, not computers)
- Clear ROI (missed calls = lost money)
- Phone-first (agents work through voice)
- Underserved (enterprise focus elsewhere)

**Your Moat:**
- Deep workflow understanding
- Voice native (not chatbot)
- Outcome pricing (not per-seat)
- Local market expertise
