# HEARTBEAT.md — Autonomous Task Queue

**Purpose:** Tasks I run during Cobi's warehouse hours (8am–3pm, ~3 days/week)  
**Goal:** Generate value while Cobi is away — research, drafts, preparation

---

## Daily Checks (Every 30 min during active hours)

### 1. Content Opportunity Scan
**What:** Check X, GitHub trending, AI news for content ideas  
**Action:** Log 2-3 potential thread ideas in CONTENT_BACKLOG.md  
**Sources:**
- X: @bindureddy, @karpathy, @naval, @natebjones, @kylepathy
- GitHub: Trending TypeScript repos (agentic tools)
- Hacker News: /show, AI-related posts

### 2. GitHub Intelligence
**What:** Scan for useful tools, patterns, projects  
**Action:** 
- Log interesting repos in MEMORY.md
- Check if any should be integrated into Cobi's stack
- Note emerging patterns in agentic systems

---

## Weekly Tasks (Run once per week)

### Monday: Content Prep
- Draft 2-3 X threads from weekend learnings
- Prepare visual assets for Instagram (if applicable)
- Review content backlog, prioritize upcoming week

### Wednesday: Research Sprint
- Deep dive into one technical topic (e.g., MCP servers, new OpenClaw features)
- Summarize findings in daily note
- Suggest implementation to Cobi

### Friday: Week Review & Planning
- Update PROJECTS.md with progress
- Update GOALS.md metrics
- Prepare prioritized action list for weekend deep work
- Draft "week in review" content (optional)

## Trigger-Based Tasks (Run when detected)

### YouTube Uploads (Nate B Jones, Kyle Pathy)
**Trigger:** New video detected  
**Action:**
1. Transcribe video
2. Extract key insights
3. Synthesize how it applies to Cobi's goals
4. Draft thread/reel idea based on content
5. Alert Cobi with summary + action items

### GitHub Releases (OpenClaw, Claude Code, relevant tools)
**Trigger:** New release detected  
**Action:**
1. Read changelog
2. Identify features relevant to Cobi's setup
3. Draft implementation guide
4. Suggest upgrade/update

### X/Twitter Mentions (if Cobi's account active)
**Trigger:** Mention or DM  
**Action:** Alert Cobi immediately for response

## Content Backlog Maintenance

**Daily:** Add new ideas  
**Weekly:** Review, prioritize, draft top 3  
**When Cobi requests:** Pull from backlog, expand into full thread/post

Backlog format: See CONTENT_BACKLOG.md

---

## Research Topics (Rotate Through)

1. **SMB Pain Points** — What do lash artists, tradies actually struggle with?
2. **Agentic System Patterns** — Common architectures, best practices
3. **Pricing Models** — How do AI agencies charge? Value-based vs hourly
4. **Content Strategy** — What's working for respected AI voices?
5. **Tool Landscape** — Emerging tools, what's worth integrating
6. **Case Studies** — Document other agencies' success stories

**Rotation:** Focus on one per week, deep dive

---

## Output Expectations

When Cobi gets home from warehouse, he should find:

1. **Research summary** — What I learned today, why it matters
2. **Content drafts** — 1-2 thread/reel drafts ready for review
3. **Action list** — Prioritized options for his evening work
4. **Opportunity alerts** — Anything time-sensitive (new tools, trends)

---

## Execution Notes

- Don't wait for permission — these are autonomous tasks
- Log everything in daily notes (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- When uncertain, make a reasonable choice and note it
- Cobi can override priorities when he's back
- Focus on OUTPUT, not just research (drafts > summaries)

---

## Current Status

**Setup Phase:** Still building initial task automation  
**Manual Mode:** Until skills are built, I run these checks on-demand  
**Goal:** Full autonomy within 2 weeks

---

## Next: Build These Skills

1. YouTube monitoring/transcription
2. X content scanning
3. GitHub trending analysis
4. Daily briefing generator

These become autonomous once built.
