# Codex Integration

## How to Use

### From OpenClaw (me):
When you ask for a complex coding task, I'll:
1. Spawn Codex to generate the solution
2. Review the suggested code
3. Apply it to your workspace
4. Commit to GitHub

### Direct Usage:
```bash
# Interactive mode (full access)
cd /Users/cobi/.openclaw/workspace
codex

# Or with specific prompt
codex "create a Python script that..."
```

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Code review  
- ✅ File analysis
- ✅ Architecture suggestions
- ❌ Direct file writes (sandboxed for safety)

## Cost
- Uses OpenAI API (GPT-5.3-codex)
- Charged to your OpenAI account
- Typically cheaper than Claude for coding tasks
