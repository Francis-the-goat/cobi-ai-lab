## X Thread: "I talked to 20 AI agency owners. 18 are building themselves a job."

**Hook:**
I spent 2 weeks talking to AI agency owners.

18 of them are building themselves a $10K/month job.

Only 2 are building a real business.

Here's the difference (and why most will fail):

**Body:**

1/ The "job" owners sell hours.

"$150/hour for AI implementation"

They trade time for money. No leverage. No scale. Just a high-paid contractor.

2/ The business owners sell outcomes.

"$5K/month to add $50K to your bottom line"

They capture value, not time. They're aligned with client success.

3/ The math is brutal:

- 40 hours × $150 = $6K/month (maxed out)
- 1 client × $5K = $5K/month (10 hours work, 4 clients = $20K)

4/ But here's what nobody tells you:

Selling outcomes requires confidence.

You have to guarantee (or strongly imply) results.

That means you actually need to know what works.

5/ The shortcut:

Don't start as an AI agency.

Start as an X expert who uses AI.

- Lead gen expert (who uses AI)
- Customer support expert (who uses AI)
- Content ops expert (who uses AI)

6/ Deep expertise + AI leverage = unbeatable.

Shallow AI skills + generalist positioning = commodity.

The market is flooding with the second type.

Be the first.

**CTA:**
I'm building an AI agency for home services (HVAC/plumbing). 

Focusing on one outcome: capturing missed calls.

If you own a service business, DM me. I'll show you exactly how many leads you're losing.
