## What This Means For You

**Current approach:** "I build AI voice agents for home services businesses"
**Better approach:** "I capture $10K+ in leads you're currently missing every month"

Nate's framework directly applies to your home services AI agent:

### Reframe Your Offer

❌ "AI voice agent for $1,500/month"
✅ "Lead recovery system — we capture the 30% of calls you miss and convert them to booked jobs. Average client adds $15K/month in captured revenue."

### Why This Works

1. **You're not selling AI** — you're selling revenue recovery
2. **Price on value** — $1,500 is cheap if they capture $15K
3. **Clear ROI** — they can measure exactly what you delivered
4. **Differentiation** — every other agency is selling "AI solutions"

### Your Specific Action

Rewrite your landing page/one-pager to lead with:
- The problem (missed calls = lost revenue)
- The number (30% missed, $X average job value)
- The outcome (capture and convert those leads)
- The ROI (typically 10x return in first month)

Then put the AI part in the "how it works" section.
