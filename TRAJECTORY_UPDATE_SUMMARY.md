# Trajectory System Update — Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** V2 deployed

---

## What Changed

### 1. New Core Document
**`TRAJECTORY_OS.md`** — Velocity-based leverage system
- Replaces static learning with signal → ship velocity
- Target: <7 days from signal to shipped asset
- Focus: Using AI change as leverage, not learning AI

### 2. Updated Systems

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Startup sequence now includes trajectory focus |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Daily signal detection + leverage extraction |
| `ai-alpha-learning/README.md` | Learning = leverage extraction, not curriculum |
| `ai-alpha-learning/mastery-log.md` | Ships tracked, not studies |

### 3. New Directory Structure

```
memory/
└── signals/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md          # NEW: Raw signal log

ai-alpha-learning/
├── leverage-briefs/            # NEW: Scored opportunities
├── mental-models/              # NEW: Reusable frameworks
└── mastery-log.md              # UPDATED: Ships, not studies
```

## Key Shifts

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Learn → Master → Apply | Sense → Extract → Ship (7 days) |
| Curriculum-based | Signal-based |
| Knowledge accumulation | Leverage extraction |
| Study then build | Build while studying |
| Perfection | Speed |
| Theory | Proof |

---

## The New Loop

```
Daily (30 min):
  └─ Scan Tier 1 sources → Log signals

When signal detected:
  └─ Score opportunity → Write brief

Weekly (5-10 hrs):
  └─ Build asset → Ship proof → Compound

Target: 1 asset shipped per week
```

## Your 3 Signal Sources (Define These)

1. **Business leverage:** Nate B Jones (YT/Substack)
2. **Tool leverage:** OpenClaw/Claude releases
3. **Market leverage:** [Your SMB vertical community]

---

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Signals/week | 3-5 |
| Briefs/week | 1-2 |
| Assets shipped/week | 1 |
| Signal → ship days | <7 |
| Content → ship ratio | 1:1 |

---

## Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **System deployed** — All files updated
2. ⏳ **Define your 3 signal sources** — Edit this doc
3. ⏳ **Set up daily 15-min scan habit** — First thing mornings
4. ⏳ **Process first piece of content** — This week
5. ⏳ **Ship first proof** — Within 7 days

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Taking notes without building
- ❌ "I'll master this first"
- ❌ Waiting for next version
- ❌ Research without application
- ❌ Perfectionism

---

## The Real Metric

**Days between "AI capability exists" → "I shipped something using it"**

- Target: <7 days
- World-class: <3 days
- Current: [TBD — first ship this week]

---

## Files to Read

1. `TRAJECTORY_OS.md` — Full velocity system
2. `ai-alpha-learning/README.md` — Updated learning approach
3. `HEARTBEAT.md` — Autonomous operation

---

## Bottom Line

The AI landscape shifts daily. Your competitive advantage isn't what you know — it's how fast you can sense change, extract leverage, and ship.

**This week:** Define signals → Detect one → Ship proof.
