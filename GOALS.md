## Monthly Review Questions

1. What did I ship this month? (Projects, content, assets)
2. What did I learn? (Technical, business, personal)
3. What's working? (Double down on this)
4. What's not working? (Kill or fix)
5. What am I avoiding? (Usually the most important thing)
6. What one thing would make next month 10x better?

---

## Anti-Goals (What I'm NOT Doing)

- ❌ Building a course (before I've done it myself)
- ❌ Chasing VC funding (self-funded, client-funded)
- ❌ Hiring employees (before $10k/month solo)
- ❌ Perfecting tools (ship with what works)
- ❌ Research without output (every learning becomes content or code)

---

## Current Status

**Month:** 1  
**Phase:** Foundation  
**Next Milestone:** OpenClaw fully operational + first shipped skill  
**Target Date:** March 3, 2026

## Reminders

- Speed > perfection

Leverage is everything.
