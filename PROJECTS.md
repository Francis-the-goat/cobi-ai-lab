### 2. Agency Foundation — Agentic Systems for SMBs
**Status:** Early Stage / Learning Phase  
**Priority:** HIGH — Revenue path  
**Goal:** Build capability to deliver agentic systems to SMBs (lash artists, tradies, small service businesses)

**What I'm Learning:**
- How to scope and price agentic system projects
- SMB pain points (what actually moves the needle for small businesses)
- Agency operations and delivery models
- Technical implementation patterns with OpenClaw/Claude/Codex

**Target Clients (Future):**
- Lash artists (partner's network)
- Tradies (father's connections)
- Small service businesses (local Gold Coast)

**Deliverables Needed:**
- Case study from personal projects
- Service packages/pricing framework
- Outreach templates
- Portfolio of shipped agentic systems

### 3. Personal Brand — X & Instagram
**Status:** Starting / Content Development  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Distribution and leverage  
**Goal:** Build respected voice in AI through substance, not hype

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Building in public** — Documenting OpenClaw/agent projects
2. **Technical breakdowns** — How agentic systems actually work
3. **Business insight** — AI × SMB value creation
4. **Learning transparency** — Honest progress, failures, wins

**Content Types:**
- X threads (technical deep-dives, insights, project updates)
- Instagram Reels (short-form, visual demos of agents working)
- Occasional long-form (LinkedIn, blog)

**Brand Values:**
- No AI guru slop
- Data-backed claims only
- Show the build, not just the result
- Real numbers, real failures, real learnings

---

### 4. AI & Agentic Systems Mastery
**Status:** Continuous / Learning Phase  
**Priority:** HIGH — Core capability  
**Goal:** Deep expertise in OpenClaw + Claude Code + Codex stack

**Current Focus:**
- OpenClaw architecture and skill-building
- Claude Code workflows and project patterns
- Codex integration and advanced usage
- Multi-agent orchestration

**Learning Method:**
- Build real projects (not tutorials)
- Document what works
- Share learnings publicly
- Iterate based on feedback
