# PROJECTS.md — Cobi's Active Work

Last updated: 2026-02-25

## Operating Tracks

1. `SMB` — client outcomes and revenue leverage
2. `UPSKILL` — AI/business capability growth
3. `BRAND` — content and distribution from real work
4. `LIFE` — personal operating systems and consistency
5. `SYSTEM` — agent architecture, tooling, and self-improvement

## Current Active Projects

### 1. OpenClaw Agent Setup & Optimization
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** HIGH — Foundation for everything else  
**Goal:** Fully operational agent with multi-model routing, autonomous capabilities, and integrated tooling  

**Completed:**
- ✅ Telegram integration
- ✅ Multi-model setup (Local Llama 3.2, DeepSeek Coder, Kimi)
- ✅ Intelligent model routing system
- ✅ SOUL.md + USER.md defined
- ✅ Quality-first model architecture (Strategist/Builder/LocalSmart/LocalCode/LocalFast lanes)

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 GitHub integration for code push
- 🔄 Codex integration for coding tasks
- 🔄 HEARTBEAT.md autonomous task queue
- 🔄 AI Business Asset Foundry (research -> deployable skill/tool pipeline)
- 🔄 Leverage OS automation (trajectory radar -> scored opportunity -> asset pack -> proof content)
- 🔄 Self-improvement loop (cron metrics -> bottleneck detection -> experiment backlog)

**Next:**
- YouTube transcription/analysis skill
- Content generation pipeline (cron-driven)
- Research intelligence system (weekly trajectory briefing)
- Lead-to-booked-job orchestrator (first foundry asset)

### 2. Agency Foundation — Agentic Systems (SMB-First Wedge)
**Status:** Early Stage / Learning Phase  
**Priority:** HIGH — Revenue path  
**Goal:** Build capability to deliver agentic systems with an SMB-first wedge across service and operations businesses, targeting 100-400% scale without added headcount and higher output quality

**What I'm Learning:**
- How to scope and price agentic system projects
- SMB pain points (what actually moves the needle for small businesses)
- Agency operations and delivery models
- Technical implementation patterns with OpenClaw/Claude/Codex

**Target Clients (Future):**
- SMB service operators (home services, health/wellness, professional services)
- SMB operations-heavy teams with manual intake, quoting, scheduling, or follow-up bottlenecks
- Founder-led local businesses where AI automation can increase throughput and output quality fast

**Deliverables Needed:**
- Case study from personal projects
- Service packages/pricing framework
- Outreach templates
- Portfolio of shipped agentic systems

### 3. Personal Brand — X & Instagram
**Status:** Starting / Content Development  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Distribution and leverage  
**Goal:** Build respected voice in AI through substance, not hype

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Building in public** — Documenting OpenClaw/agent projects
2. **Technical breakdowns** — How agentic systems actually work
3. **Business insight** — AI × monetization and operator leverage
4. **Learning transparency** — Honest progress, failures, wins

**Content Types:**
- X threads (technical deep-dives, insights, project updates)
- Instagram Reels (short-form, visual demos of agents working)
- Occasional long-form (LinkedIn, blog)

**Brand Values:**
- No AI guru slop
- Data-backed claims only
- Show the build, not just the result
- Real numbers, real failures, real learnings

---

### 4. AI & Agentic Systems Mastery
**Status:** Continuous / Learning Phase  
**Priority:** HIGH — Core capability  
**Goal:** Deep expertise in OpenClaw + Claude Code + Codex stack

**Current Focus:**
- OpenClaw architecture and skill-building
- Claude Code workflows and project patterns
- Codex integration and advanced usage
- Multi-agent orchestration

**Learning Method:**
- Build real projects (not tutorials)
- Document what works
- Share learnings publicly
- Iterate based on feedback

---

### 5. Personal Operating System (Life Leverage)
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Consistency multiplier  
**Goal:** Build systems that improve execution consistency, focus, and energy while balancing warehouse work

**Current Focus:**
- Daily planning rhythm with clear top priorities
- Reduced context-switching and less reactive decision-making
- Repeatable review loops (daily/weekly) tied to real outcomes

**Deliverables Needed:**
- One-page daily planning protocol
- Weekly review checklist tied to goals and track balance
- Simple habit and execution scoreboard in `memory/`

## Project Queue (Next 4 Weeks)

| Week | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Week 1 (Now) | Finish OpenClaw setup | Build first skill (YouTube analyzer) |
| Week 2 | Create 3 X threads from learnings | Test Local models with real tasks |
| Week 3 | Build agentic system demo for portfolio | Document and share build process |
| Week 4 | Outreach prep (templates, target list) | Content batching for consistency |

## Completed Projects

- 2026-02-25: Integrated Scrapling web-monitor capability into `radar-system` with configurable high-signal sources and change detection output.
- 2026-02-25: Added `self-improvement` automation pipeline with run-metrics sync, experiment recommendations, and daily report generation.
- 2026-02-25: Defined `LEVERAGE_OS.md` and installed operating framework for SMB-focused agentic opportunity selection.
- 2026-02-25: Added `smb-agentic-opportunity-radar` skill scaffold and radar pack generator.
- 2026-02-25: Added leverage automation scripts (`install_leverage_crons.sh`, `leverage_setup_audit.sh`).

---

## Blocked / Waiting

- Multi-profile Telegram polling can conflict (`409`) if `main` and `dev` use the same bot token at the same time. Keep one gateway active per token.
- Elevated run context is still required from sandboxed sessions for live gateway and cron operations.

---

## Notes

- Keep projects tight (1-2 week sprints max)
- Ship before perfect
- Document everything for content
- Each project should produce: working asset + content + learning + one personal execution improvement
