# Validation Evidence for Build Candidate

## Validated Signals Used

1) **Intent engineering is a decision-quality bottleneck**
- Evidence file: `memory/2026-02-26.md`
- Signal: synthesis explicitly states intent layer is emerging differentiator and maps a 5-part policy structure (primary metric, secondary metric, trade-off, escalation, rollback).
- Why it supports this asset: template directly operationalizes this structure.

2) **System reliability issue requires deterministic policy behavior**
- Evidence file: `memory/2026-02-25.md`
- Metric: model mismatches 4/5 runs (80%) on `radar-daily-scan`.
- Why it supports this asset: when routing/tool choices drift, intent policy provides stable business behavior and escalation boundaries.

3) **SMB ROI anchors are available for practical template fields**
- Evidence file: `memory/2026-02-26.md`
- Metrics cited in synthesis: email personalization 20-40% revenue lift; baseline web conversion 2-3% with potential improvement.
- Why it supports this asset: fields can be populated with non-speculative baseline/target ranges.

## Plan Alignment
- Plan file: `memory/plans/2026-02-26-plan.md`
- Alignment: primary track SYSTEM; objective emphasizes reliability-first before broader revenue execution.
- This asset is low-infrastructure and reusable within 48 hours.

## Validation Quality Notes
- Some external statistics were flagged in synthesis for primary-source verification before external publishing.
- Internal use is acceptable for prototype-level template creation; external claims require source hardening.
