## The Signal

Home services is experiencing rapid AI adoption among owner-operators with 3-20 field techs and $1M-5M revenue. Speed-to-lead is the critical bottleneck — missed calls directly equal lost revenue.

**Why Now:**
- Regal.ai, Retell AI, Avoca all have dedicated home services verticals
- Angi, Kohler, Pella already deployed
- YC-backed players entering (market validation)
- Seasonal demand swings create urgency for automation

**The Bleed:**
- Missed calls = immediate revenue loss
- Manual lead qualification burns human reps
- Appointment scheduling becomes phone tag
- No-shows kill daily yield without automated follow-up
- Post-service followup rarely happens (team moves to next job)
