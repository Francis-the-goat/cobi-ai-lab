# Validation Plan: Home Services AI Agent

---

## Validation Philosophy

Before building the full system, validate that:
1. **The problem is real** — Business owners confirm the pain
2. **The solution is wanted** — Demo generates "when can I get this?" response
3. **The price is acceptable** — Target market agrees $1,500/month is reasonable
4. **The willingness to pay exists** — Letter of intent or deposit

**Time to validate:** 3-5 days  
**Cost to validate:** $0 (conversations only)

## Phase 1: Problem Validation (Day 1-2)

### Objective
Confirm that speed-to-lead and missed calls are real, expensive problems for local HVAC/plumbing businesses.

### Method
Direct outreach to 5 local home service businesses. Goal: 3 conversations.

### Target Profile
- Gold Coast/South East Queensland area
- 3-15 employees
- Owner-operated (owner answers phones or is involved)
- HVAC, plumbing, or electrical focus
- Active online presence (Google Business, website, social)

### Outreach Script (Email/DM)

```
Subject: Quick question about your call handling

Hi [Name],

I'm Cobi — I'm researching how local service businesses handle 
inbound calls and scheduling challenges.

Quick question: How do you currently handle after-hours calls 
and emergency inquiries? Do you find you're missing opportunities 
when you're on jobs?

I'm not selling anything — just doing research for a project. 
Would love 10 minutes of your insight if you're open to it.

Thanks,
Cobi
```

### Discovery Questions

**Opening:**
- "Walk me through what happens when someone calls your business at 6 PM on a Tuesday."
- "How do you handle calls when you're on a job?"

**Problem Depth:**
- "How many calls do you think you miss in a typical week?"
- "What's your current process for returning missed calls?"
- "How quickly do you typically respond to inquiries?"

**Cost of Problem:**
- "Have you ever estimated what a missed call costs you?"
- "What's your average job value?"
- "How many leads convert to booked jobs?"

**Current Solutions:**
- "Have you tried any solutions for this? (Answering service, additional staff, etc.)"
- "What happened with that?"

**Pain Level:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this for your business?"
- "What would change if you never missed another call?"

### Success Criteria
✅ **3+ owners confirm missed calls are a significant problem**  
✅ **At least 1 owner quantifies the cost ("probably losing $X/month")**  
✅ **Current solutions are unsatisfactory ("tried X, didn't work because...")**

### Red Flags (Pivot Signal)
❌ "We don't really miss calls"  
❌ "Our customers just leave voicemails and we call back"  
❌ "We have a full-time receptionist, it's fine"

## Phase 2: Solution Validation (Day 3-4)

### Objective
Demo a prototype and measure enthusiasm/willingness to adopt.

### Method
Mock demo using Retell AI playground or simple prototype. Show, don't tell.

### Demo Script

**Setup:**
- Pre-configured Retell AI agent with business-specific greeting
- Sample conversation flows (booking, emergency, FAQ)
- Simple Cal.com booking page connected

**Demo Flow (15 minutes):**

1. **Context (2 min):** "I built an AI assistant that answers calls, qualifies leads, and books appointments 24/7. Let me show you how it would work for your business."

2. **Live Demo (5 min):**
   - Call the demo number
   - Walk through: "Hi, my AC is blowing hot air"
   - Show qualification, booking, confirmation SMS
   - Show owner notification

3. **Reaction Check (3 min):**
   - "What do you think?"
   - "How would this change your day-to-day?"
   - "What concerns do you have?"

4. **Pricing Conversation (3 min):**
   - "If this captured 2-3 extra jobs per week, what would that be worth?"
   - "Would $1,500/month make sense if it meant never missing a call?"
   - "Most businesses see ROI within the first month."

5. **Next Steps (2 min):**
   - "Would you want to pilot this for 30 days?"
   - "I can have it set up for your business within a week."

### Success Criteria
✅ **Owner says "when can we start?" or similar**  
✅ **No major objections ("sounds too complicated", "don't trust AI")**  
✅ **Pricing feels reasonable or cheap ("that's less than a part-time employee")**  
✅ **Owner agrees to pilot or provides LOI**

### Red Flags
❌ "Let me think about it" (no enthusiasm)  
❌ Major objections about AI/voice quality  
❌ "That's too expensive" (price sensitivity)

## Phase 3: Commitment Validation (Day 5)

### Objective
Convert interest into concrete commitment (pilot agreement or deposit).

### Offer Structure

**Pilot Program:**
- 30-day pilot
- $500 setup fee (covers configuration, training)

- Shows serious interest without legal complexity

**Strong:** Pilot Deposit
- $500 setup fee paid upfront
- Fully refundable if not satisfied after 30 days

### Success Criteria
✅ **1+ signed LOI or pilot deposit**  
✅ **Clear timeline for implementation**
