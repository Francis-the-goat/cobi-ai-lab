## 🎯 The Opportunity

Home service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical) lose 20-40% of inbound leads to missed calls and slow response times. An AI voice agent that answers 24/7, qualifies leads, and books appointments captures revenue that otherwise disappears.

**The Numbers:**
- 96% reduction in time-to-answer
- 41% increase in monthly conversions
- $200K+ annual revenue impact for 10-tech company
- 3,900%+ ROI on AI investment

**Why Cobi Wins Here:**
- Concrete ROI data from existing vendors (Regal.ai)
- Local Australian market = less competition
- Warehouse/trades background = authentic positioning
- Simple pitch: "Never miss another call"
