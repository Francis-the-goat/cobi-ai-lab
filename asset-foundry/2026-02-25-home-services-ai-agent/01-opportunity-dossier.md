# Opportunity Dossier: Home Services AI Agent

---

## Buyer Profile

**Primary:** Owner-operator of local service business  
**Company Size:** 3-20 field technicians  
**Revenue:** $1M-5M annually  
**Pain Level:** HIGH — seasonal swings, missed calls = immediate revenue loss  
**Tech Sophistication:** Low to medium — uses basic scheduling software, maybe ServiceTitan/Jobber  
**Decision Speed:** Fast when ROI is clear — owner makes decisions, no procurement cycle

**Psychographic:**
- Wears multiple hats (sales, ops, dispatch)
- Feels constant pressure to answer phones while managing crews
- Frustrated by "tire kickers" wasting quote time
- Knows they miss opportunities but can't justify full-time receptionist
- Worried about negative reviews from poor communication

---

## The Problem Stack

### 1. Speed-to-Lead Crisis
- 78% of customers book with the first responder
- Average home service business takes 15-45 minutes to return calls
- After-hours calls go to voicemail (30-40% of leads)

### 2. Qualification Burnout
- 60% of inbound calls are low-intent (price shopping, wrong service, out of area)
- Owner/techs spend 20-30% of day qualifying instead of serving
- No system to prioritize high-value jobs (emergency vs. routine)

### 3. Scheduling Friction
- Phone tag for 2-3 days to book single appointment
- No real-time availability checking
- Double-bookings and scheduling conflicts common

### 4. No-Show Epidemic
- 15-25% no-show rate in home services
- Each no-show = lost revenue + wasted tech time
- No automated reminder/rescheduling system

### 5. Follow-up Gap
- Post-service review requests rarely sent
- Referral opportunities missed
- Maintenance reminders non-existent (recurring revenue lost)

## Current Workarounds (Inadequate)

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| Hire receptionist | $35-50k/year, still only 9-5, sick days, training |
| Answering service | Generic, no qualification, just takes messages |
| Voicemail | 80% hang up, zero conversion |
| Web forms | 60% prefer calling for urgent needs |
| Hire more techs | Doesn't solve bottleneck, just adds capacity to broken system |

---

## Desired Future State

**Inbound Call Flow:**
1. AI answers 24/7 in < 5 seconds
2. Qualifies caller (service type, location, urgency, budget indicator)
3. High-intent → books appointment in real-time (checks tech availability)
4. Low-intent → captures info, schedules callback, sends pricing guide
5. Emergency → immediate dispatch to on-call tech
6. Sends confirmation SMS with prep instructions

**Outcome:**
- Zero missed calls
- 80% of bookings happen without human touch
- Techs arrive to qualified, prepared customers
- Reviews requested automatically post-service
- Maintenance reminders drive recurring bookings

## Competition Analysis

| Vendor | Strength | Weakness | Gap for Cobi |
|--------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Regal.ai | Enterprise features, proven ROI | Enterprise pricing, complex setup | SMB-focused, simple deploy |
| Retell AI | Voice AI platform | DIY, requires technical setup | Done-for-you + local focus |
| Avoca | Industry-specific | Limited customization | Custom workflows per trade |
| ServiceTitan | All-in-one | Expensive, bloated, poor AI | Lightweight, AI-native |

**Entry Angle:** Local Australian market specialization + trades-specific workflows (HVAC has different needs than plumbing)

## Validation Checkpoints

1. **Problem Validation:** 3 local HVAC/plumbing business owners confirm pain
2. **Solution Validation:** Demo gets "how soon can you install?" response
3. **Pricing Validation:** Owner agrees $1,500/month is "no-brainer if it works"
4. **Willingness to Pay:** Signed letter of intent or deposit
