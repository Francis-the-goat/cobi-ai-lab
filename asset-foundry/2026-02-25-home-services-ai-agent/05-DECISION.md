# Asset Pack Decision: PROTOTYPE
**Asset:** Home Services AI Agent  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Decision:** PROTOTYPE — Proceed with validation sprint  
**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## Why PROTOTYPE (Not BUILD NOW or REJECT)

**Not BUILD NOW:** Validation checkpoints are incomplete. The validation plan explicitly requires 3+ owner conversations and 1+ LOI before build. Skipping validation risks building something the market doesn't want.

**Not REJECT:** Signal strength is HIGH with concrete ROI data (Regal.ai case studies: 96% faster answer, 41% conversion increase). Asset pack is complete. Australian market has less competition. Cobi's warehouse background creates authentic positioning.

**PROTOTYPE is correct:** Run the 5-day validation sprint to confirm problem/solution fit before committing to 7-day build.

## 7-Day Validation Sprint Plan

### Day 1 (Today) — Setup & Targeting
- [ ] Review asset pack in full (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up Retell AI account ($25 free credit)
- [ ] Identify 5 local HVAC/plumbing businesses (Gold Coast area)
- [ ] Research: Google Business, websites, social presence
- [ ] Draft personalized outreach messages

**Deliverable:** Target list with contact info + draft messages

### Day 2 — Outreach Blitz
- [ ] Send 5 outreach emails/DMs (use validation script)
- [ ] Follow up on non-responses (phone call if number available)
- [ ] Aim for 3 conversation commitments
- [ ] Schedule calls for Day 3-4

**Deliverable:** 3+ scheduled validation calls

### Day 3 — Problem Validation Calls
- [ ] Conduct 2 owner conversations (30 min each)
- [ ] Document: pain level, quantified cost, current workarounds
- [ ] Fill validation scorecard

**Deliverable:** 2 completed discovery calls + notes

### Day 4 — Solution Validation
- [ ] Conduct remaining owner conversation(s)
- [ ] Build simple Retell AI demo (if not already done)
- [ ] Run demo for interested owners
- [ ] Gather reaction and pricing feedback

**Deliverable:** 3+ validation conversations complete + demo reactions

### Day 5 — Commitment & Decision
- [ ] Review validation scorecard
- [ ] Pursue LOI or pilot deposit from interested owners
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision:
  - **GO (5+ checkpoints passed):** Proceed to 7-day build sprint
  - **PAUSE (3-4 checkpoints):** Address gaps, extend validation
  - **PIVOT (<3 checkpoints):** Reassess opportunity

**Deliverable:** Clear decision + commitment or pivot plan

### Day 6-7 — Build Prep (If GO) or Pivot (If Not)

**If GO:**
- [ ] Finalize pilot business selection
- [ ] Set up accounts: Retell AI, Cal.com, Airtable, Twilio

## Success Criteria by Day 5

| Checkpoint | Required | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Problem validated (3+ owners confirm pain) | ✅ | ⬜ |
| Quantified pain (cost estimate from owner) | ✅ | ⬜ |
| Solution demo complete | ✅ | ⬜ |
| Positive reaction to demo | ✅ | ⬜ |
| Pricing accepted ($1,500/month feels reasonable) | ✅ | ⬜ |
| LOI or pilot deposit secured | ✅ | ⬜ |

**Minimum for GO:** 5 of 6 checkpoints passed

---

## Key Risk & Mitigation

**Risk:** Owners don't respond to outreach, can't validate in 5 days  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use multiple channels (email, DM, phone)
- Expand search radius if needed (Brisbane area)
- Consider offering $50 gift card for 30-min conversation
- If <3 responses by Day 3, pivot to healthcare vertical (similar pain, proven demand)

---

## Economics Reminder

**If validated and built:**
- Setup fee: $3,000-5,000
- Monthly: $1,500/business
- Target: 10 businesses = $180K ARR
- ROI for client: 3,900%+ first year

**Validation cost:** $0 + time (12-15 hours over 5 days)

**Build cost (if validated):** 7 days full-time + ~$150-300/month tooling

---

## Next Best Action (Right Now)

1. Open Retell AI and create account
2. Google "HVAC Gold Coast" and open first 5 results
3. Draft first outreach message using validation script
4. Send by end of day
