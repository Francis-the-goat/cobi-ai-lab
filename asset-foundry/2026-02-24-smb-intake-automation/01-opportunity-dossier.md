# Opportunity Dossier - smb-intake-automation

## Scope
- Buyer: SMB service or operations business owner managing high-volume lead and scheduling workflows
- Job-to-be-done: Convert inbound leads into booked jobs without manual follow-up chaos
- Business outcome target: Higher lead-to-booking rate and faster first-response times

## Evidence Pack
- Source 1: Internal target-client profile from [PROJECTS.md](/Users/cobi/.openclaw/workspace/PROJECTS.md) (SMB service + operations focus)
- Source 2: Common SMB workflow patterns (DM/text/forms -> manual quote -> follow-up gap)
- Source 3: Current stack constraints (OpenClaw + Telegram + model routing + 24/7 agent runtime)

## Current Workflow (As-Is)
1. Lead arrives via DM, text, or form while owner is busy on jobs.
2. Owner replies manually later, asks repeated qualification questions.
3. Quote/follow-up slips, lead goes cold, booking not captured.

## Flaw Map
- Failure mode 1: Slow first response (often outside buyer intent window)
- Failure mode 2: No standardized qualification and quote readiness check
- Failure mode 3: No reliable follow-up cadence or missed-lead recovery loop

## Quantified Bottleneck
- Metric: Median first-response time to new leads
- Current baseline: 2-12 hours (owner dependent)
- Estimated improvement potential: <5 minutes automated first touch + same-day quote prep

## Why Existing Alternatives Fail
- Generic chatbots do scripted FAQ, not job-specific qualification + quote packaging.
- CRMs are too heavy for solo operators and break if setup is not maintained.
- Owners need "done for me" conversational intake tied to real booking outcomes.

## Monetization Path
- Budget owner: Business owner/operator
- Pricing model candidate: Setup fee + monthly retainer tied to lead handling volume
- Initial offer: "Lead-to-Booked-Job Assistant" pilot for one niche with 14-day ROI checkpoint
