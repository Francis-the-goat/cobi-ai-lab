## Drafts In Progress

### DRAFT 1: X Thread — "The 58% Number"
**Status:** Ready for review | **Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Source:** Radar scan + NHS validation

---

**HOOK (Tweet 1):**
58% of dental practices are committing to AI automation in 2026.

The other 42% have 6-12 months before the window closes.

Here's what the data actually says →

---

**BODY (Tweet 2-5):**

**2/** The NHS just deployed voice AI for 1.6 million people.

Not a pilot. Not "experimenting with AI."

Production. At scale. Working now.

This matters because it eliminates technology risk for every SMB healthcare practice.

**3/** $2.1 billion in claims were processed via AI/RPA in 2025.

That's not hype. That's infrastructure being rebuilt.

The practices automating first aren't "early adopters" anymore.

They're the new baseline.

**4/** What changes in the next 6-12 months:

• Patients expect instant scheduling (24/7, not business hours)
• Insurance verification happens in seconds, not days  
• Follow-ups run without staff lifting a finger

The gap between automated and manual becomes uncloseable.

**5/** The real question for practice owners:

Not "Should we automate?"

But: "Do we build this competence now, or buy it later at a premium?"

Because the 58% aren't just buying software.

They're buying optionality.

---

**CTA (Tweet 6):**
If you're in the 42%:

I help healthcare practices deploy voice agents and automation without the enterprise complexity.

DM me "AUTOMATE" and I'll share the exact 3-step framework NHS validated at scale.

---

**METRIC CLAIM:** "58% of dental practices committing to AI in 2026; NHS voice AI deployed to 1.6M people; $2.1B claims processed via AI/RPA in 2025"
**CTA:** "DM me 'AUTOMATE' for the 3-step NHS-validated framework"
**CREDIBILITY:** NHS production deployment at scale (not pilots), concrete dollar figures
**SMB OUTCOME:** 24/7 scheduling, instant insurance verification, automated follow-ups → competitive parity with early adopters

---

### DRAFT 3: X Thread — "Fix the Foundation First"
**Status:** Ready for review | **Date:** 2026-02-27 | **Source:** Daily synthesis — SYSTEM blockers

---

**HOOK (Tweet 1):**
My agent system has an 80% routing failure rate.

Not a bug in the logic.
A bug in the orchestration layer.

Here's why I'm stopping all builds to fix it →

---

**BODY (Tweet 2-5):**

**2/** I spent yesterday building an SMB intent template.

This morning I checked the logs: 4 out of 5 tasks routed to the wrong model.

Local jobs hitting premium APIs. Complex jobs hitting lightweight models.

The cost bleed is real. But worse — the outputs are wrong.

**3/** My Foundry experiment (auto-building assets) is at 67% success.

Sounds okay? It's not.

Zero post-activation validation runs completed. No evidence the fixes actually work.

Building on broken infrastructure is just building debt faster.

**4/** So I'm stopping everything.

No new features. No content threads. No SMB outreach.

Until:
→ 0 model mismatches in consecutive runs
→ 2/2 Foundry validation passes at ≥95%

Constraint-forced clarity: reliability before leverage.

**5/** The temptation is to push through.
"It's good enough. Ship it."

But I work warehouse shifts 8am-3pm.
I get 4 hours a day to build.

If I build on broken ground, I'm wasting my only leverage.

---

**CTA (Tweet 6):**
Every builder hits this moment.

Fix the foundation, or keep patching cracks?

I chose foundation. What would you choose?

---

**METRIC CLAIM:** "80% model routing drift (4/5 mismatches); Foundry 67% success with 0 validation runs"
**CTA:** "Fix the foundation, or keep patching cracks? What would you choose?"
**CREDIBILITY:** Real telemetry from own system, transparent about failure
**INSIGHT:** Building on unstable infrastructure compounds waste, not leverage

---

### DRAFT 4: Reel Script — "The 80% Failure"
**Status:** Ready for review | **Date:** 2026-02-27 | **Length:** 30-45 seconds

---

**[0-3s] HOOK (Visual: Error logs scrolling rapidly)**
*Text overlay:* "80% failure rate"
*Voiceover:* "Four out of five tasks. Wrong model. Wrong cost. Wrong output."

**[3-8s] PROBLEM (Visual: Split screen — simple task burning GPT-4 tokens, complex task hitting lightweight model)**
*Voiceover:* "Simple jobs hitting premium APIs. Complex jobs hitting weak models."

**[8-15s] STAKES (Visual: Calendar — 4 hours highlighted in red)**
*Voiceover:* "I work warehouse shifts. I get four hours a day to build. Building on broken ground? That's not hustle. That's waste."

**[15-25s] DECISION (Visual: STOP sign, then wrench/tools)**
*Voiceover:* "So I'm stopping. No new features. No outreach. Until routing hits zero mismatches and validation passes ninety-five percent."

**[25-35s] INSIGHT (Visual: Foundation vs. building on cracks diagram)**
*Voiceover:* "Constraint-forced clarity. Reliability before leverage. Fix the foundation, or keep patching cracks?"

**[35-43s] CTA (Visual: Text overlay)**
*On-screen text:* "Comment FOUNDATION — how do you handle blockers?"
*Voiceover:* "How do you handle it when your own system breaks? Comment FOUNDATION."

**[43-45s] END CARD**
*Text:* "Building in public → Follow"

---

**METRIC CLAIM:** "80% routing failure rate, 4 hours/day build window"
**CTA:** "Comment FOUNDATION — how do you handle blockers?"
**CREDIBILITY:** Raw telemetry from actual system, transparent constraint profile
**INSIGHT:** Limited time forces clearer prioritization — reliability gates all leverage
