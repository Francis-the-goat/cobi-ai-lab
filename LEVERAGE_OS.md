# LEVERAGE_OS.md — AI Trajectory -> SMB Asset Engine

Last updated: 2026-02-25

## Objective

Build a system that continuously turns fast-moving AI change into high-value SMB agentic offers and assets.

Definition of "high-value":
- Clear buyer with budget authority
- Measurable business outcome (speed, conversion, margin, quality, throughput)
- Deliverable in <= 7 days for first proof
- Repeatable enough to productize

## Five-System Architecture

## 1) Trajectory Radar (What changed?)

Cadence:
- Daily quick scan
- Weekly deep synthesis

Signal categories:
- Frontier model capability changes (reasoning, tool use, multimodal)
- Orchestration/runtime changes (OpenClaw, MCP, automation infra)
- SMB adoption signals (case studies, tooling behavior, pricing shifts)

Output:
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` signal log (only high-signal entries)

## 2) SMB Pain Map (What matters economically?)

Track repeat bottlenecks in SMB ops:
- Lead intake and qualification
- Quoting and follow-up
- Scheduling and dispatch
- Client communication latency
- Reporting and QA workflows

Output:
- Ranked pain list with owner, frequency, and current cost of delay

## 3) Opportunity Scoring (What is worth building now?)

Use foundry rubric and reject weak opportunities.

Minimum thresholds:
- Pain urgency >= 4
- Economic value >= 4
- Build speed >= 4

If below threshold, park it.

Output:
- Decision: `BUILD NOW`, `PROTOTYPE`, or `REJECT`

## 4) Asset Foundry (What gets shipped this week?)

For top-ranked opportunity, produce:
- Opportunity dossier
- Asset specification
- Validation plan

Path:
- `asset-foundry/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`

Output standard:
- Explicit KPI target
- Implementation scope for 7 days
- Kill criteria

## 5) Proof + Distribution Loop (How leverage compounds)

For each shipped asset, produce:
- 1 public proof artifact (thread/reel/case snippet)
- 1 commercial artifact (offer update/outreach angle)
- 1 delivery artifact (template/skill/tool update)

This ensures learning compounds into audience + pipeline + product.

## Weekly Cadence (Default)

Monday:
- Weekly trajectory brief + top 3 opportunities

Tuesday-Thursday:
- Build and validate one asset candidate

Friday:
- KPI review + next-week prioritization

Saturday/Sunday (optional deep work):
- Productize into a reusable skill/tool and content asset

## KPI Stack

Business:
- Qualified SMB opportunities identified per week
- Pilot conversations started
- Conversion from opportunity to paid build

Delivery:
- Assets shipped/week
- Median days from idea to first proof
- Validation pass rate

Distribution:
- Proof artifacts published/week
- Inbound leads/DMs tied to proof content

## Decision Rule

If a task does not increase one of:
- Revenue likelihood
- Delivery capability
- Distribution proof
- Skill capital

then deprioritize it.
