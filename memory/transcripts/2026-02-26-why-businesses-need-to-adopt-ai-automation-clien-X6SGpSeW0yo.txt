Hey, hello everyone. This is Sanjith. I'm an AI\h consultant at Velzflow.ai where we help founders\h\h and CEOs scale their business by implementing AI\h into their day-to-day business operations. So,\h\h today I've got a very special guest, Garrett from\h PAdvertising Partners based in New Jersey. So,\h\h Garrett and I have been working together for\h almost a year now and we've built a great\h\h relationship along the way. So, he's also been\h a mentor to me and someone that we could learn\h\h a lot from. So Garrett has been in the marketing\h industry for almost two decades and he manages\h\h monthly ad budgets over six figures for his\h clients in his agency. Thank you so much sir\h\h for taking your time to do this call with me. I\h really appreciate it and uh yeah uh how are you\h\h doing today? Oh thank thanks for the intro. I'm\h I'm I'm doing great Sanjith. Happy to uh happy\h\h to be on a call here and talk some uh automations\h and AI with uh uh Velzflow.ai and uh and yourself.\h\h Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Thank you so much, sir. So,\h it's Saturday. You don't work on the weekends. Um\h\h I work every day. I think one of my favorite lines\h I've ever heard in entrepreneurship came from\h\h uh Zuckerberg when someone asked him, "How many\h hours do you work a week?" And he said, "Well,\h\h I work 40 hours a week, but I am on mission 247."\h And I think that's a little bit I kind of I kind\h\h of go with that. I mean, I work every day. I do\h touch points on my stuff every single day, but I\h\h I work a pretty normal uh normal work life during\h the week. Wow. Amazing. Yeah. Like another day,\h\h another dollar, right? Yeah. Yeah, man. It's uh\h uh it's out there to win. um when I like to win\h\h for my clients and and and I I I work with\h smart people like you to to help that. So,\h\h uh I I I take it super seriously and and I\h enjoy doing it. So, I I don't mind Saturdays\h\h and Sundays. I touch I touch my client's accounts\h every single day. Wow. Amazing. That's amazing. My first question for you is, you know, it's\h pretty straightforward. So when did you real So I\h\h think we met about a year ago. So when or how did\h you realize how did you come to this journey of\h\h automations process streamlining? Yeah, it it it\h just came down to it's it's something that I think\h\h most marketers if they've been around for a while\h uh doing automations and workflows is something\h\h you always wished you could do through all these\h years. And then in the last couple years with some\h\h software and and and all the different uh large\h language models automations and implementing\h\h those automations became I would say available\h to the uh the smaller market like like we are\h\h right we wouldn't be you know big companies out\h there been running automations for a really long\h\h time but have I ever been able to automate\h uh for the local plumbing guy or a smaller\h\h e-commerce person or um uh roofing companies\h where you weren't able to do that. So, it's\h\h uh it's just the natural evolution of wanting to\h stay in better contact with customers and increase\h\h workflows and efficiency. So, it's something I\h always wanted to do and just correct the tools\h\h weren't available and the people like yourself\h weren't always available who had that expertise\h\h just yet five years ago or six years ago.\h Yeah, you're absolutely right. So automations\h\h was something all these tools make and zapio they\h existed for for almost a decade now but once when\h\h AI came in you know automation just went to the\h next level and you know it just became a whole\h\h new industry right the service providers never\h existed before just specifically for automations yeah 100% because it just wasn't available\h right I mean yeah you know Zapier's been\h\h around a long time But early Zap days, it\h was complicated and the softwares didn't\h\h talk well to each other and it was hard\h to understand and it was hard to connect\h\h and it was hard to test and it was just\h hard and it's still not simple. You need\h\h someone who thinks about this daily and who\h has expertise and how these things work and\h\h and and that that's that's always that's where\h you came in about a year ago. Okay. Thank you. The other question that that I wanted to\h ask is while you're managing ad budgets\h\h over six figures. So you got to make sure the\h delivery is there's no issues in the delivery,\h\h right? So when these third party platforms\h or APIs for example pixels go down or you\h\h know the data structures gets changed all of a\h sudden it could you know come in and interrupt\h\h our workflows and you know break without even\h a warning all of a sudden. Right. So yeah, and\h\h there are a lot of operational risks when it comes\h to a huge ad budgets. So how do you manage all of\h\h these risks and any points about that? Sure.\h So so a lot of these uh risks we'll call them\h\h um do pop up when when when when automations and\h you're trying to connect things and uh the way we\h\h manage that is is is I send you a message uh\h that something's not working. But one of the\h\h one of the great things about automations in the\h positive sense is that when things don't work,\h\h it also lets you know. Yeah. Exactly. Uh so you\h do get some notifications and you do get like, oh,\h\h hey, by the way, this piece broke. And it happens\h all the time from the perspective of I think one\h\h of the main issues you you and I have worked on\h over the last year is the transfer of data from\h\h these pixels that I put on client websites that\h uh identify users, right? And then we have to flow\h\h that information through email uh verifications.\h We have to flow that into Clavio to ping it.\h\h Then we have to flow it back through into the\h actual correct workflows. And um there's three or\h\h four softwares being connected and routed through.\h And I've woken up on mornings and all of a sudden\h\h I see notifications that nothing went through.\h And then you and I take a look and you say,\h\h "Okay, well the data structure changed from the\h information that we were capturing was laid out\h\h like this." And today it's different. It's laid\h out like this and you've got to remap it and and\h\h you got to have the brain for that. I I look at\h that I see a completely foreign language. I can\h\h understand. I know what I'm looking at, but it to\h me it's foreign language. To you it's uh it speaks\h\h directly to what your brain understands. I don't I\h don't understand. I understand. I know that I need\h\h help. That's where I've excelled in my life. Okay.\h Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. talking about the ROIs or you know the results\h that you've had. So I think we've implemented\h\h like various systems and could you talk about\h any I think we've used blogging and implementing\h\h CRM. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean the the the ROI on\h automations is actually infinite. It it really\h\h can't be measured in terms of a percentage.\h And I I'll give you uh two direct examples.\h\h one one example from e-commerce, one example from\h local marketing, right? I I I I help a lot of\h\h different people in our business. So, let's take\h uh e-commerce. That workflow which captures the\h\h data of potential buyers, cleans it and flows\h it through in the last 12 months has produced,\h\h this is real, $248,000 in incremental revenue for\h this e-commerce client. That is not theory. That\h\h is not potential. That is the meeting last week\h I had with the client regarding the pixels and\h\h the workflows and the automations that you set\h up. My my idea, you took my idea and actually\h\h turned it into action. That action has produced\h $248,000 for the client in the last 12 months in\h\h 2025. So that's one that you can't measure that\h that is that is January 1st 2025. They did not\h\h have that income or revenue existent or even in\h their brains as a possibility. We took the idea,\h\h the automations, the workflow and a lot of\h troubleshooting over the last 12 months produced\h\h that for that client. So that's tremendous. So\h that's that's piece one. Piece two that you and\h\h I have worked on is blogging automation for my\h local clients. Correct. And the importance of\h\h that is that uh now a small operator, a a a\h roofing guy, a plumbing guy, an electrician\h\h guy that might have a couple of trucks who is now\h competing with uh very largecale operations. Now\h\h the internet is big. These companies are huge. So\h how can you compete? And the way you can compete\h\h is in Google maps and content. And the blogging\h automation has helped clients Google business\h\h profiles show up in maps to get more calls. So\h they're getting more calls because we are able to\h\h automate content down onto their site to send the\h signals to Google that we're relevant in this area\h\h and we produce blogs and we we have activity. So,\h uh, being able to set that up for small operators\h\h at a really reasonable cost, uh, the automation\h on that, again, you can't calculate the ROI on\h\h getting an extra 100 phone calls for your roofing\h company because you've used blogging automation\h\h or you and I have set up blogging automation to\h keep their sites relevant and and uh, taggable\h\h and we embed the maps and all that stuff. So ROI\h on automations, no one can look at automations\h\h as an expense. It doesn't cost you money.\h Correct. Automations do not cost money. Yes,\h\h I pay money for the softwares. I pay money to to\h to have things set up. It is not an expense. It is\h\h pure asset building. And and each automation you\h set up is just another asset for your business.\h\h So if you're not doing it, you're you're you're\h you're going to lose much quicker than you used to\h\h lose. Exactly. Talking about this saving of your\h time. So I think previously uh you were your your\h\h team members were creating the blogs manually,\h right? Like you got to create blogs in WordPress\h\h for different clients manually, right? But now\h how does that have changed right now? Yeah. So the\h\h autom so yes we were you know doing standard you\h know blogging and and and using vendors and things\h\h like that and and now we plug in the niche the\h location into the workflow correct and I believe\h\h it's connected out to like perplexity that helps\h with uh the appropriate titles and the and the\h\h locations and everything and then it works its way\h through. So what you set up, I'm not 100% sure. I\h\h know that it works and I know that it it it it has\h removed I can now take my VAS and my team members\h\h and do things that I can wasn't able to do before\h because I was spending money on blog posting and\h\h all these other things. Now I don't have to spend\h money on that and I can spend money on getting\h\h results in other areas and really expanding my\h clients revenue, expanding their assets, expanding\h\h their footprints and and just incrementally\h winning a little bit more each day. And none\h\h of that is possible if you don't have automations.\h Exactly. Cool. Yeah. None of it. Amazing. Amazing. Let us talk about the tools. So although the\h outcome matters, you know, it's interesting\h\h to talk about these tools because whenever\h someone asks me like do you recommend Make\h\h or N8N or Zapier, I would just literally\h use you as an example to explain to them\h\h like hey I've got a client Garrett he uses n\h for this purpose he uses make for this purpose\h\h because both have their own pros and cons right\h because I think it would be great that if you\h\h go ahead and explain from your perspective on\h why you use both of these tools and how they,\h\h you know, influence your business\h and so on. Sure. Well, first off,\h\h I'll give you all the credit on why I use both.\h I pushed back on I pushed back on using make,\h\h correct? Uh, initially and I was like, well,\h let's do, you know, I saw this thing about\h\h N8N and and and you set some things up on\h N8N. And then what I really appreciated was\h\h and and this is important for anybody watching\h your people that you work with, your partners,\h\h your uh vendors, the people you use and work\h with. Um you have to trust what they say and and\h\h uh understand and listen and also find vendors\h like yourself who just don't take what I want\h\h and just do it. It's well hey what you want is not\h as good as what I can do now that you understood\h\h what I was talking about like okay well yeah\h I see what you're saying but this should be in\h\h make and and let me explain the differences I want\h to just sign in through applications through make\h\h and through these things where it's just so native\h it's so simple where nadn comes in in my business\h\h and in my belief over the last year is if there's\h a lot of things that have to talk to each other,\h\h if there's a lot of moving parts, although the\h cost in N8N is significantly less. So, we use N8N\h\h for blogging and it's a fantastic workflow and it\h works great. We use make for the client that has\h\h uh that we're capturing you a 100,000 pieces of\h data over the last 30 days parsing that out into\h\h where it needs to go and then connecting it to\h all other different softwares. Amazing. You know,\h\h let me put that share my perspective now. So what\h you said is absolutely right and and the reason\h\h why you have felt that way is because I think\h make is much more easier not for you for anyone\h\h to manage understand learn and you know implement\h I think you've built automations yourself in make\h\h right just by using yeah some some simple ones I\h couldn't do what you created but yeah like some\h\h simple ones like a little data comes in connects\h it to here and then goes over there yeah so make\h\h is easier to understand debug and all these\h stuff but Again I would feel that an adden is\h\h as powerful as make.com um when it is hosted in\h the right place and you know set up right when\h\h it comes to the budget. So if the client is like\h I'm getting like thousands and hundreds of data\h\h flowing every single day in that case you know in\h is always a solution. So, so that is why you're\h\h you know some of the workflows for you is set up\h on in and only properly budgeted ones is set up on\h\h make. Right. Right. Yep. Basically that's that's\h that's correct. Correct. The ones where we knew I\h\h and I knew that it was going to be mass amounts of\h data and I didn't want to revisit it constantly.\h\h I said I I have the budget. I let the client\h know this is you know what you want. There is\h\h cost to this. Yeah. Make is um all the platforms\h are great. I was always blown away with N8N and\h\h railway on how anyone would even know how to do\h any of that. If you asked me to set something up\h\h on N8N and railway, I wouldn't be able to do it.\h If you ask me to say, "Hey, can you set this up\h\h on make?" I could do it. Exactly. Is it going to\h be high level? No, but I could do it. Yeah. But\h\h I couldn't even N totally looks like gibberish.\h I'd pull up Nadn. I'm like, I don't even know.\h\h I don't know what anybody's talking about on this\h platform, but it is cool and it does work. not an\h\h innate end knock, but if you want to, you know, if\h you get a little uh if you get an email from make\h\h that maybe one of your scenarios uh didn't, you\h know, maybe broke and you get that email and it's\h\h a Saturday night, I can at least feel confident I\h could troubleshoot my way to maybe a solution if\h\h I wanted to right there. Exactly. Then get on the\h horn with you on Saturday or Monday morning. Yeah,\h\h exactly. Okay. So, I feel the difference because\h it's it's popped up many many times that you know\h\h these softwares change. I we have an emailing\h our emailing uh verification software is changing\h\h everything for January 5th or 6th. So, you and I\h Yeah. Yeah. I just got that email like three days\h\h ago. I'm like why? Like why why it works great.\h Why is anything changing? But you and I are going\h\h to have to go in there the day after, get the new\h APIs and and and reconnect everything. I mean,\h\h that's got nothing to do with uh with us. For\h anyone who's watching this, make is easier to set\h\h up, easier to work with, especially you're you're\h a beginner or someone who's not into development.\h\h And nin is all you know everything is achievable\h in nin but you just got to you know learn it take\h\h your time to learn it and an is working their best\h to you know come as equivalent to make so that\h\h it's easier for users to understand but still make\h is something that is easier for everyone right so my next question or it's not a question though\h it's like asking your opinion and what I mean\h\h what do you feel what advice would you have for\h people in the marketing and especially in in the\h\h advertising industry or maybe you could say for\h all of the businesses on how they should survive\h\h in this AI boom because people are going to get\h replaced because we're not going to be operating\h\h exactly like how we do today right things are\h going to change so what advice or thing points\h\h that you'd like to give for them well I'll I'll\h tell you what I talk to everybody about on my\h\h sales calls or or uh any outreach to me. I've been\h doing this a long time. PE people reach out to me\h\h for for advice and and thoughts on things all the\h time. And and I'm I'm actually taking a really\h\h hardline approach now and saying like listen, if\h you're not adapting AI to every corner of your\h\h business and if you're not adapting automations\h into every possible area of your business,\h\h you're going the acceleration of your loss is\h going to be extreme where maybe up until now\h\h you got away with not getting a lot of reviews.\h Maybe you know you send some direct mail or you\h\h don't have re a good outreach. You don't have\h live chat. You don't have an AI chat. You don't\h\h have anything on the back end for outreach\h and staying in front of customers. You have\h\h nothing. Automations and AI really help with\h personalization for marketing and advertising.\h\h If you're not doing any of that, what I guarantee\h is somebody in your market is. Someone's being\h\h pitched right now. I onboarded four clients this\h month. All because the conversation started with\h\h I'm not showing up in chat GPT. What do we do?\h And then I look at their business and I say, okay,\h\h well, you haven't had a review in a year. I called\h your business line twice. Nobody answered. Uh, you\h\h run no ads. You have no personalization. You have\h no emails. You have no blogging. Chat GPT is the\h\h worst of your problem. We need live chat. You need\h missed call text back. You need workflows. We need\h\h uh you should be sending direct mail to people\h who hit your website. That's an AI automation\h\h system. Correct. uh if you don't do those things,\h people are getting those things implemented at a\h\h really good cost, right? The the the the benefit\h of AI, if you understand how you want to use it,\h\h it's very cost effective in relation to the output\h of what you get from it. Correct? So, you're going\h\h to get blown out of the water way faster now that\h AI is here and automations are here than you did\h\h from when you started your business maybe 25 years\h ago and you haven't really done much, but you you\h\h survived and you made money and everything, but\h now you're getting to the point where you want to\h\h retire. your business is a little bit more mature,\h your kids want to take it over, and you actually\h\h don't have a business anymore because the guy who\h started his plumbing company 12 months ago has\h\h double the amount of reviews, a nicer website, his\h his voice AI answers his calls off hours to take\h\h appointments. He's running ads using AI software.\h He's blocking fraudulent click. He's just blowing\h\h you out of the water with a few tools and one\h smart guy who can do it all for a good cost and\h\h uses smart people to help him like like Sanj and\h best blow AI up in here. Yeah. Amazing. Appreciate\h\h that. So yeah, so whenever you know I ask someone,\h hey, you want to implement AI and if they give\h\h me like, hey, no, we're not interested, we don't\h have, you know, I I just genuinely feel, you know,\h\h pity on them. I'm like, I feel sad for you. I'm\h not upset. Yeah. You know, yeah. It's like I I\h\h you know, I did a sales call the other day with a\h guy and he booked afterwards and and what I said\h\h to him said, "Listen, it it doesn't matter if you\h do any of this or not. You just told you're down\h\h over the last two years. You're not making as much\h money as you used to. And what I'm telling you,\h\h the only way to recover is AI automations,\h aggressive offers, new website, live chats.\h\h You have to meet the customer where they are.\h And now where customers are now in their buying\h\h journey. I hate that term buying journey. The\h expectation of the customer is highle customer\h\h service. Answering the phone, showing up on time,\h seeing ads, reaching out, sending emails, touch\h\h points, text messages. It seems overwhelming.\h Yep. Until you realize someone tells you, "Dude,\h\h this can all be done with automation. You actually\h don't have to do any of it. You just have to say\h\h yes and you can save your business or at least\h give yourself a fighting chance. If you don't\h\h do this, I would say just close now. Save the co\h save all your money. Shut it down now and you'll\h\h be in better position. If you do nothing in two\h years, someone's going to just blow you out of\h\h the water with using modern tools. my modern tools\h using 2025 tools. Yeah. For your that didn't exist\h\h in 2020. Correct. So, well, yeah, you're right.\h I I think this is a smart advice. Rather than,\h\h you know, not implementing all these, you could\h better shut down because anyway, next few years,\h\h you got to Yeah, just do something else. Yeah,\h there's no problem. It's not a big deal. You're\h\h you can pivot. do it now or or you're going to be\h out of business. I told a guy a couple days ago,\h\h HVAC guy, been in business 20 years. He's like,\h "It's failing." I said, "I I you you wouldn't even\h\h have to tell me that your business is failing. You\h could have just sent me your website and I would\h\h have called you and said, "You have no online\h presence. No one answered the phone. I filled\h\h out a form on your website. Didn't get a return\h email. Didn't get a text. Didn't get a phone\h\h call. No wonder you're going out of business.\h Your customer from 20 years ago is not your\h\h customer anymore. Your customer today expects\h instantaneous customer service, communication,\h\h and outreach. And the reason they expect it\h is because it's actually pretty simple to do.\h\h And if you're unwilling to do it, they'll just\h find someone else who meets them where they are,\h\h which is driving in your car texting. As dumb\h as that sounds, the contractor or the guy or the\h\h legent who contacts that person back immediately\h wins the business. Exactly. Made it a lot. Even\h\h in e-commerce, yeah, e-commerce, too, you you need\h to be emailing, you need to be personalizing, you\h\h need to be you need to be capturing data, you need\h to be texting, uh you need to be using AI in your\h\h ad platforms, in your fraud blocking platforms.\h You need workflows set into Clavio like all of\h\h these things. If you don't do it, there's lots of\h people who are who win. Yeah, definitely. And back\h\h in the day, you need a real humans to respond,\h email back, and all these stuff. But right now,\h\h you don't need anyone. You just need an AI system\h that just get backs to your lead. You just need\h\h a system. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what I would\h tell anybody uh Sanjith and velzflow.ai like\h\h the ROI on automations and having an automation\h consultant on your Rolodex is so important in a\h\h modern business in a 2025 and beyond business.\h If you are not automating, systemizing,\h\h and processing as much as you possibly can and\h using a consultant like Sanjith, you're going to\h\h lose guaranteed much sooner than later because\h someone's doing that for your competitors are\h\h doing it. Yeah. Guaranteed. And thank you, sir.\h That's all I pitch all day long. Okay. Yeah. And\h\h thank you for your kind words. And Yeah. And\h what you said is absolutely right. I mean they\h\h don't have to use me but they got to use anyone\h that knows automations and they got to you know\h\h transform their business and adopt to this new you\h know new way of how businesses are running right uh we've had a great discussion and you\h know I I want to really appreciate you for\h\h uh for making the time to do this call with\h me and for anyone who's looking to implement\h\h AI and automations based systems into your\h business feel free to reach out And yeah,\h\h that is all I got to say. Any more words,\h sir? Uh, no, just just just if you need AI,\h\h you need automations. I am 15 plus years, 20 years\h in this game. Sanjith is a highlevel operator. Uh,\h\h he thinks he's not an order taker. He's going\h to ask you questions. He wants it done right.\h\h and and and and he stands by his work and uh he's\h very very available which is also important for\h\h automations because when things break can't\h be like oh I'll get to it in a week. It's hey\h\h something's off. Yeah. Needs immediate. It's like\h talk to you tomorrow morning. Yeah. Yeah. Like\h\h I'll talk to you tomorrow morning. And and you've\h been uh you've been so responsive, so helpful.\h\h uh I wouldn't have been able to do any of the\h stuff uh successfully without your help. So uh\h\h if you need if you need help automations any uh\h consulting and you need someone who's going to\h\h think and use their brain and not just take your\h order, this is the guy who's going to help you\h\h figure it out. So, thank you so much all the all\h the luck in the world and and and everything and\h\h thank you for helping our business and our clients\h and and I I hope I can continue to grow it with\h\h you and watch you grow your business, too.
