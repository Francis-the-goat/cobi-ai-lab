every company in the world and every workflow for every company and every industry will be re-engineered in 24 months this is a tsunami this is a tsunami of change and only the Smart Ones are going to recognize I have to plant the flag now whether the story is complete or not is not the issue the train is moved out it's on the flight so so you're a small business owner wanting to learn more about II I totally get it I am to 12 months ago I decided to dedicate my entire life to this and by doing so I've actually blown my own mind about what is possible so in this video I'm going to talk about how small business owners should adopt Ai and especially AI automation this year without getting caught up in the hype of AI agents or AI voice Bots or AI bots in general because the number one problem that small business owners have is lack of time so I do not want to waste your time I consider myself a business owner I don't really consider myself a content creator that's why I get really annoyed when I see these content creat say things like this AI tool should feel illegal and it makes me just want to get up and run the opposite way and it really leaves a bad mark on the AI industry whereas what is actually possible right now is you as a business owner you have proven processes of how you produce content you have proven processes of how you launch new products you have proven processes of how you write emails there are so many proven processes in your business today that are making you money that are still getting done manually by maybe yourself or a team member which can actually be automated maybe 50% maybe 60% maybe even 90 to 95% of that workflow can be automated by AI using AI tools that you're probably aware of like chat gbt but building them in very different ways using automation tools like make.com even zapia and these other tools that are out there however the challenge is like I said most business owners don't have time so you know you could be doing more but you don't really know where to spend that time effort energy Focus money all of those things that come along with going and learning a new skill in this video I want to help solve that and if you don't know me yet my name is Mitch Assa and I've built a number of six and seven figure businesses over the last 12 plus years now and what I'm most passionate about is solving real problems for real businesses making real money not just Theory not just AI hype like I really am interested in how can we find the best solutions that are viable today not something that's coming in 12 months time or 2 years time how can we use these Sol solons today that are proven in order to drive more growth to make everyone in your team more efficient and hopefully increase your profit margins as well so you can make sure that the work that you're doing is worth it how does that sound good so today we're going to be talking about a few things of stop start and continue what are those types of things that you should be doing but before I do dive into that my last business was a pet care education business we did $1.5 million in the first year and eventually uh we grew to like 10 team m members I was building business the old way which is scale up with more team members more software tools more risk more complexity more management that needs to happen more therapy of the team members and all of that blew up after making two really bad decisions in a row and we ran out of cash we had to fire seven team members during that period which was probably the worst uh experience that I've had in business getting rid of team members that are really enjoyed working with who were doing great what we ended up having to do was rebuild a business from the ground up and and it just forced me to think entirely differently around what can we actually do with our workflows than just hire more people all the time and that's what led me down to at the time we using chat GPT in the dashboard was making this a little bit more efficient but it led me down into realizing we could actually use preset workflows for things like automating everything to do with YouTube automating everything to do with podcasting and Summits we're doing a lot of those at the time automating complete workflows for newsletters as well so that I could take my processes and build a system that my team could follow that virtual assistance making you know $10 to $20,000 a year could follow and still produce the same quality as me so that alleviates having to hire a really expensive staff all the time and their team members offshore can actually be just as productive even more productive and produce really high quality work fast forward a few months later we had three team members instead of 10 and they basically running the entire business for us producing the same amount of output as before and that's really what led me I mean I ended up selling that company but that's what led me here to this point of now helping small business owners adopt AI automation into their businesses so in this video we're going to be talking about what small businesses really want I've already told you that you want more profit ultimately at the end of the day which means making your team members more efficient and ensuring high quality and it also means moving so much faster so you can launch more products launch more content all of those types of things eventually is going to create more profit for you we're also going to be talking about how small businesses should adopt AI I'm about to dive into that now we'll be talking about why you should be cautious listening to most content creators I already mentioned that and what you should keep doing as a small business owner this is probably the other thing is a lot of the content that I see out there on AI is it makes you feel like you're behind all the time and that does nothing productive for anybody except make you feel maybe a little bit overwhelmed and not really knowing what to do and instead of doing something you do nothing at all whereas I don't think you're G to get left behind if you're a successful business owner right now you've already proven yourself in the market and honestly 90% of the AI tools out that are out there are absolutely too hypy and not really useful for real businesses making real money so don't get caught up in that trapped of feeling like you're behind all the time because after the rest of this video then you're going to understand what you should keep doing what you should start doing and what you should maybe stop doing as well and then the final one there is what you should stop doing and wait for them to become proven first as a small business owner and that's where I'm really going to start with like these few here that you can see in large letters which are AI Bots there are some people using them yes are they super effective not really I have I used them on customer service websites yes do I like them no they me off so much but if you look around at the most of the ads people running ads online is they they're pushing AI Bots why because they're new and exciting and it does cool stuff but does it really drive any growth in the bottom line in my opinion it doesn't another one is AI voice assistance this is pretty interesting maybe in there's maybe like 5% of use cases this could be useful but if you think about it from a customer point of view do if they call up do they really want to speak to a robot probably not at least not at this stage rather than spending 5 10 15 grand getting someone to install a voice assistant then let's wait and for maybe five years until that's proven where people are used to it and people enjoy it and you know that there's going to be a really great response rate from that until you invest your time effort energy money focus into that particular system the other one you're going to hear a lot about this year is AI agents do I think AI agents are going to completely change the way business is done absolutely will it be this year probably not as you can see with all of the other hype cycles that have come in AI before us it usually for the first year maybe two years of the AI hype cycle for this new tool this new thing the product itself that is new and exciting isn't really viable for most businesses however because content creators especially and the businesses themselves are so good at hyping that product and making it sound absolutely unbelievable you feel like you're getting left behind whereas in fact I've dived into basically every new product that comes out and 95% of them need like a 2 or threee Runway from the time you first hear about them in order to become something that is useful for business owners so don't get too CAU up in those just yet if you want to know when AI agents become good subscribe to this Channel and I'll definitely tell you when we do start using them with really great use cases inside of real businesses the other things that you might want to stop doing is creating something brand new with AI so like it's the it's a typical response from every entrepreneur we always on something new and exciting the shiny object syndrome right whereas the best way to actually implement I and I'm going to talk about this in a moment is taking existing proven workflows I I even talked about it at the start you have proven workflows you don't want to be building something brand new just because AI can do it we can take existing things that are proven that are making us money that everybody in the business knows about that your customers get are getting results from we can take those processes and we can use AI instead I'm going to give an example just in in a bit as well the other things that we should probably stop doing are fully automated AI videos there very few channels out there on YouTube that are making this work there are some channels that have voiceovers that are doing quite well on YouTube you see them a lot but are they doing that fully automated with AI absolutely not not at this stage at least are they using AI in parts of those workflows probably but fully automated AI videos is nothing but a someone trying to sell you a product so you don't even get caught up in those things the other thing that can become quite overwhelming in this SP is keeping up with the latest announcements even me in this base every single day I just turn off I unsubscribed for most newsletters I turned off a lot of YouTube channels and content because it gets overwhelming and distracting so like I said there's usually a hype cycle of about two to three years of a certain way of doing things before it actually becomes viable so I'm actually looking at like what was the thing that was that was being said 12 months ago and has that progressed today also chasing every new AI tool maybe there's a little bit of uh fun in doing this you know Finding different tools on appsumo or anywhere where they have some really great deals there are some tools that are great but here's the number one problem that I found when I had problems in my pet care education business I went through all of the tools that we were using and there was about 30 different tools that my team were using and what I realized is that the complexity in the workflow of going from this tool to that tool to that tool to that tool back to this tool back to that tool and then to another tool before we publish like all of that part of of the process was taking an extra 10 minutes per tiny workflow an extra two hours per longer workflow where we could just set up a few automations and remove like five or six or seven of those tools out of the workflow because it's fully automated inside of you know some of these automation tools like m.com yes we should look at new tools every now and then but be very cautious adding them into your workflow because of the complexity of like changing through different tools and the context shifting and that type of stuff and then the other thing is if you are going to experiment then you should experiment with a goal so if you're experimenting for no reason and you think it's going to be helping your business then make sure you have a goal so that then leads us to okay what should we start doing instead and I'm going to talk about what are the things we should keep doing as well because that is also important you're already doing a lot of things if you are a successful business owner that are great some of the things that we should start doing is replace chat GPT or Claude or Gemini with automation as much as possible so what do I mean by this so you have your chat GPT dashboard that is a Sandbox where you can ask at anything you can insert anything and it's great it's it's been huge for most businesses however we can actually do things way faster and smarter by taking the prompts that we used all of the time and putting them into like a prompt library inside of a database tool for example and anytime we run say a YouTube workflow we might have five or six different prompts that we use in order to produce all the things that we need for that YouTube video what we can do is we can line up those prompts in a in a workflow and hit the one button and it will take your inputs and then it will produce all of the outputs that you're asking for so normally what you would normally do in chat jbt is you would put those six prompts in manually by yourself each individual time sometimes the prompts might be different so you don't really know if the prompts are good or if AI is bad or what's going on whereas we can take a lot of these processes instead of doing it manually we can automate it with make.com and these types of tools the other thing we could start doing is replace proven processes with AI automation I mean I've wrote it here twice accidentally but it's really like everything that I'm going to be talking about this year because this is the secret replacing proven processes with AI automation like I said if you're you have a process that is helping you generate leads every single month why not make that process more efficient why not go deeper on that process so and why not do more of that process without having to hire more people like that is the Holy Grail in business is how can we do proven things better faster and more efficiently with less amount of people like so that's the most obvious place to start but it's not the most obvious place for most people because we mostly get caught up in the hype cycles of AI creators newsletters all of those types of things the other thing that we could start to do is centralize our Workforce to a single database tool and what I mean by this and there'll be tons of other videos on my channel where I talk about different workflows inside of AD table is we're building everything out of tools like ad table where we can create our own custom content workflows so that that becomes the main dashboard for the business so normally you would have like say your project management tool where you managing projects and then once you start creating projects you might have some spreadsheets tracking stuff you might have some Google docs to help with those things maybe you do a little bit extra stuff inside of your project management tools we could even use your some of these project management tools as a database where you are storing all of your let's call it your YouTube videos and they're stor get installed in a database and within that database we can create triggers into automations where we can automate our workflows for things like writing all of the content scripting writing descriptions we can even automate generating images based on our brand like there's so many different things we can do if we start thinking from a more advanced level as a small business owner thinking more like a tech company so the reason why most tech companies are not hiring thousands and thousands of Staff every year now like they used to is because they're automating so much of their workflows so they're essentially building databases for different parts of their business having a schema with all of the different things that they need for those workflows and automating those workflows with AI so that humans within the business they only need to add in a little bit of input a large amount of the let's call it the knowledge work or the The Specialist work that used to happen is now done by Ai and then the human the same human who put the input in like a higher level manager is now picking up the output making a few edits and and putting that work into production however that may look that used to only be accessible by big tech companies with expensive developers but now small business owners are able to do the exact same thing now that can get quite overwhelming if you have tons of processors and teams and people in your business so all you need to do what I would recommend is just choose one per month what is one workflow per month that is processed out right now that someone in your team is following how can you take that and automate that inside of your business or begin to automate at least parts of it inside of your business using these tools like m.com and I have a membership called the massive moves membership there'll be a link in the description below and each month we do a 7-Day Sprint called the map and make Sprint which does this this exact thing where we take an existing proven workflow we map it out in like a tool like this like mirror board we map it out as a mind map or a workflow a flowchart and then we can see very clearly what are the steps that we take in order to create each of these workflows and then we figure out which parts of that that workflow we can automate and often it's like 80% of the workflow can be automated you just don't know it yet because you don't know the tools you don't know the processes is the way that works we can build it then a prompt Library the benefit of a prompt library is the same prompt gets used over and over again which means if you need to improve the prompt you can improve it there one time and your in team will then have access to the prompt Library moving forward so you always have the the most up toate prompts if you have a prompt Library when you're using it inside of a database but then there's some other interesting things that we can start to do as well which is kpi our team on efficiency gains so I what I've implemented as of literally last week with my team is that I'm doing this for two reasons I'm getting them to track all of their time on task today so it's a brand new business which means we have to automate basically the whole business again but I'm getting them to track their task today and eventually I'll be able to pull a report that says at the start of the year my team used to spend 10 hours a week on this task then we automated it now they're spending one hour per week on this task which is a 90% efficiency gain so like if I can have some clear data around that that's going to be really cool but Al like just in general if you set a kpi on for your team to get it more efficient then they're going to focus on it they're going to put importance on this and they're going to actually hopefully Implement that as well if you haven't started doing it then documenting all your workflows within the business is going to be super critical because like I said if we come back to our choose one proven workflow per month to automate our map and make workflow then we want to make sure things are documented first so we can then automate them if you don't if things are not documented then you don't really know what happens so we want to do do that and you can simply do that just by doing like a loom screen share also we want to train our team on AI automation so I mean maybe getting them involved in the community as well do some regular automation Audits and maybe you need some extra help whether you hire an internal team member to automate stuff or you can get some contractors involved and to help automate and build and Implement AI for you as well which we do if you want to check that out on the website and then I want really want to make sure that I drive home the parts that you're also doing well if you're here watching this this far then I've been speaking about how you're probably a successful business owner already so you have your proven processes where you are doing some manual teamwork just because there's AI automation available today and you don't want to stop doing those things I imagine you're probably not going to stop doing those things but the manual teamwork is actually what improves the process it's actually CR a critical part of AI automation is doing the manual teamwork first to prove that the process actually works a lot of beginners I find are trying to do it the opposite way they're trying to automate something from the start before it's proven and then they have a really hard time creating the product selling the product because it's not really solving an issue they don't understand how to actually solve the issue properly manually first we should also keep using chat GPT and Claude like some a lot of people that are come into my community at least like oh well if I do AI automations then I'm paying for my developer account can I just get rid of chat jbt or cord I mean you could but the tools are so good that you need there's some times where you don't want to automate things you want to ask some oneoff questions you want to get some oneoff prompts you want to check that a manual process works before automating it so I would still suggest using some of these tools and what we should keep doing if you do have those proven processes then make sure you just keep documenting them even if you're not in a position to automate with AI right now by hiring a new team member to do that for you or hiring a contractor like us to do that for you then you should start documenting the successful processes you have and the important parts in that are of course what you do like what are the steps in documenting that process but the important part now that we have with AI is why are you doing it so what does the thought process what does the ideation phase look like why are you if you're writing an email why are you sending that type of email to this customer at that time what are you trying to get across to them how do you relate to them if you can document those things as well not just the stepbystep here is how you move through the dashboards that's when you can get really great workflows automated with AI because we can then train the AI to think exactly like you which is scary but also beautiful as well it's amazing to me how many business owners are so scared of AI but for their whole lives have been saying I wish I could just duplicate or replicate myself and I'd have no problems with my team members because they would think just like me there is an opportunity now to do that you if you can pull out your internal thought processes of how you do things why you do things then we can start to build those into AI systems so you can become way more productive so that is my presentation on how small business owners should adopt AI automation this year and just I mean all of that feedback is just in general that all of those things I just mentioned are going to stay true no matter what phase of AI is in which is there's going to be a hyp cycle of technology that is coming out latest and greatest stuff right now most of that is probably not going to be useful for real businesses for one maybe 1 to three years time so don't get caught up too much in that take your existing processes and improve them make them better automate them use AI to think just like you so that you can have more time and money for doing whatever you want basically that's bit if you do want to work with us head to big mov.io and I'll see you in the next video
