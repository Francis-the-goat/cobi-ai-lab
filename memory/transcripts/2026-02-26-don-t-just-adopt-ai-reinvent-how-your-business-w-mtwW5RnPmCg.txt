Think back to just a couple years ago. AI exploded around the world. And with it came a promise. To be able to use this technology to get work done in a new way. Fast forward to today and what’ve we got? Fragmentation, multiple systems, inconsistent workflows, outcomes are not meeting expectations. Where’s the real value? Time to deliver on the promise of AI. With Accenture and ServiceNow, you don’t just adopt AI. Here’s the difference. You reinvent the way your business works. ServiceNow’s partnership with Accenture isn’t just another alliance. We’re showing up differently, every single day. So let’s take a closer look at a typical day. One of the largest logistics organizations in the world needed to lay down a completely new IT infrastructure. They have scale but little coherence. Perfect fit for ServiceNow. We mapped out an AI strategy. On the principle of any data, any AI, and any workflows. Accenture brings deep industry and domain expertise. ServiceNow brings the cloud native AI platform. Together, delivering outcomes no one else can. It’s about understanding the business inside and out. That’s when trust is formed. And when that happens, AI goes from theory to practice. From a promise to performance. The result? Processing times reduced by 90%, search time decreased by 30%, and millions in savings. Real AI transformation in the real world. This story is a microcosm of our synergy. We can do this locally and globally like no other. So the next time someone asks. How do I separate hype from impact? ServiceNow and Accenture have the answer. Our partnership is about one thing. Delivering outcomes no one else can. We know why AI projects fall short. We have to start challenging why work has always been done certain ways. That’s exactly where ServiceNow and Accenture are leading together. Helping our customers reinvent work where it matters most. Delivering a new promise for a new era. Together we’re going to change ways of working for the future. And it means putting people at the center, to truly transform how business gets done. Through a partnership built to put AI to work the way it was meant to be.
