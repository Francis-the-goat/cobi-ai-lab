# Intel Synthesis — 2026-02-26

## Track Declaration
**Primary:** SYSTEM (reliability blocker active)  
**Secondary:** SMB (validated use cases ready for asset extraction)

---

## What I Did
- Ingested 2 fresh source cards (SMB AI tools, enterprise case studies) and 2 prior cards (Nate video clean)
- Analyzed 2026-02-26 resource harvest: 20 videos, 10 HN stories, 3 queued for transcription
- Reviewed self-improvement ledger: 14 runs, 86% success, 4 model mismatches flagged
- Cross-referenced "intent engineering" framework with HN signals (Muscle-Mem, Hive)

**Artifact References:**
- Source: `memory/sources/2026-02-25-nate-qwzlpn164w0-clean.md` (intent layer framework)
- Source: `memory/transcripts/2026-02-26-ai-tools-for-small-business-7-ways-small-busines--y4swMaeJeI.txt` (7 use cases)
- Harvest: `memory/research/2026-02-26-resource-harvest.md` (HN signals: Muscle-Mem 226 pts, Hive 107 pts)
- Ledger: `memory/2026-02-25.md` (model routing drift: 4 mismatches)

## What Matters

### Finding 1: Model Routing Drift Is Blocking Execution (SYSTEM)
**Evidence:** Self-improvement ledger shows `radar-daily-scan` has 4 model mismatches — config specifies `ollama/qwen2.5:7b`, execution routes to `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`. This is a **reliability regression** that increases cost and breaks local-first design intent.

**Metric:** 4 mismatches in 5 runs = 80% drift rate on this job.

**Implication:** Until routing is deterministic, autonomous workflows cannot trust model-cost assumptions. This blocks cost optimization experiments and local inference scaling.

### Finding 2: "Intent Engineering" Is the Emerging Differentiator (UPSKILL/SMB)
**Evidence:** Nate's framework identifies three-layer agent architecture (context → workflow → intent). The "intent layer" (machine-readable goals, trade-offs, escalation rules) is where competitive moat forms. This aligns with HN signal "Muscle-Mem" (behavior cache for agents) and "Hive" (self-generating topologies) — both encode learned intent/policy for reuse.

**Metric:** Organizations with weak intent alignment show 74% no tangible AI value (per Nate's cited Gartner-type stats — flag: verify primary source before external use).

**Implication:** Cobi's SMB deliverables should lead with intent-layer design, not model selection. The blueprint extracted from Nate's video (primary outcome metric + secondary efficiency metric + trade-off rule + escalation trigger + rollback condition) should become mandatory in all foundry asset specs.

### Finding 3: SMB Use Cases Have Validated ROI Anchors (SMB)
**Evidence:** SMB AI tools transcript cites concrete benchmarks: 20-40% email revenue lift from AI personalization, 2-3% baseline web conversion (doubling/tripling with AI optimization), <2 minute response time targets for chatbots.

**Metric:** Email personalization: 20-40% revenue lift; Conversion optimization: 2x-3x improvement from 2-3% baseline.

**Implication:** These anchors can anchor Cobi's client conversations with defensible numbers, not speculative ROI. The seven use cases (content, social, email, insights, local SEO, chatbots, conversion) map directly to service business pain points.

## Decision
**DECISION:** PROTOTYPE — Build a "SMB Agent Intent Layer Template" that encodes Nate's five-element intent policy into a reusable markdown scaffold. This bridges the SYSTEM reliability work (deterministic agent behavior) with SMB asset creation (client-ready deliverables).

**Why:** Addresses the active reliability concern (intent drift) while producing a tangible SMB asset that differentiates on "intent engineering" rather than model hype.

## Top 3 Next Actions

1. **Fix Model Routing (SYSTEM) — Today**
   - Add explicit `payload.model` pinning to `radar-daily-scan` job config
   - Add pre-run provider health check (Ollama availability test)
   - Target: 0 model mismatches in next 5 runs

2. **Create Intent Layer Template (SMB/SYSTEM) — Tonight**
   - Build `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md` with five required sections: Primary Outcome Metric, Secondary Efficiency Metric, Trade-off Rule, Escalation Trigger, Rollback Condition
   - Seed with email personalization example using 20-40% revenue lift anchor
   - Gate: Template must be usable for any of the 7 validated SMB use cases

3. **Queue High-Signal Sources (UPSKILL) — This Weekend**
   - Prioritize transcription of OpenAI's "Intro to Agent Builder" (official production workflow guidance)
   - Prioritize "Muscle-Mem" GitHub deep-dive (behavior cache = intent persistence layer)
   - Target: Extract implementation patterns for OpenClaw skill architecture

## Risk + Mitigation

**Risk:** Intent layer concept is abstract for SMB buyers; may sound like enterprise jargon.
**Mitigation:** Anchor every intent policy element to a concrete business metric (response time, booking rate, revenue per email) and provide a one-page visual template, not a theoretical framework.

---

## One-Line Focus
Fix model routing drift today so autonomous workflows can trust their execution environment, then encode the intent layer template for immediate SMB asset reuse.

## Source Attribution
| Source | Type | Key Signal | Quality |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| Nate B Jones video | YouTube | Intent engineering framework | Strong (with verification flags) |
| SMB AI tools video | YouTube | 7 use cases, ROI anchors | Moderate (affiliate-heavy) |
| Muscle-Mem (HN) | GitHub | Behavior cache for agents | High (226 pts, operator-built) |
| Hive (HN) | GitHub | Self-generating topologies | High (107 pts, runtime evolution) |
| Self-improvement ledger | Internal | Model routing drift pattern | Primary (system telemetry) |

## Under-Served Track Check
- **LIFE:** No substantive output in 48h. Next synthesis must include one LIFE action (personal execution system) unless blocked by SYSTEM reliability issue.
- **BRAND:** Source material ready; content funnel can draft thread on "intent engineering" once template is built.
