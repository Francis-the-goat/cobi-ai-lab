# Intel Synthesis — 2026-02-27 (Midday)

## Track Declaration
**Primary:** SYSTEM (active reliability blockers unresolved)  
**Secondary:** SMB (intent template ready to build once SYSTEM clears)

---

## What I Did
- Reviewed daily plan from Orchestrator (2026-02-27 06:55 AEST): SYSTEM primary justified by 80% model routing drift + Foundry experiment awaiting validation
- Checked for completion artifacts on 5 assigned objectives: no evidence yet (midday checkpoint, execution in progress)
- Cross-referenced plan quality gates with current state: 0/6 gates confirmed complete
- Validated track-balance rule: yesterday was SYSTEM, today remains SYSTEM due to unresolved blockers — legitimate per ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md priority order

**Artifact References:**
- Plan: `memory/plans/2026-02-27-plan.md` (Strategist-generated, 6 quality gates defined)
- Prior synthesis: `memory/2026-02-26.md` (identified routing drift 80% rate, exp-2026-02-25-27403 validation needed)
- Active context: `memory/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` (reliability > monetization until blockers cleared)

## What Matters

### Finding 1: SYSTEM Blockers Remain Critical Path (SYSTEM)
**Evidence:** 80% model routing drift on `radar-daily-scan` (4/5 mismatches) and Foundry at 67% success with 0 post-activation validation runs. No evidence of fix deployment yet at midday checkpoint.

**Metric:** 0 model mismatches target vs 80% current drift rate; 0/2 Foundry validation runs completed.

**Implication:** All asset building remains blocked. Resource Harvester was gated behind SYSTEM validation ("do not harvest if builds are failing") — no 2026-02-27 harvest file exists, confirming block. Asset Builder assignment was conditional on ≥95% Foundry success.

**Decision Gate:** If routing fix and Foundry validation complete by evening, weekend build cycle unblocks. If not, weekend shifts to manual debugging.

### Finding 2: Four Non-SMB Actions Queued, None Confirmed Complete (Track Balance)
**Evidence:** Daily plan assigned concrete outputs to UPSKILL (voice drill file), LIFE (planning protocol), BRAND (thread outline), and SYSTEM (routing fix + Foundry validation). No file artifacts detected at midday.

**Metric:** 0/4 non-SMB track artifacts confirmed; 0/6 quality gates passed.

**Implication:** Track-balance rule satisfied at planning stage (forced cross-track actions) but execution verification pending. Risk: warehouse shift (per plan risk flags) may block evening work, forcing async handoff with incomplete objectives.

### Finding 3: SMB Intent Template Blocked by SYSTEM (SMB)
**Evidence:** `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md` does not exist. Plan explicitly gated this behind SYSTEM validation — correct prioritization per constraint profile.

**Metric:** Template 0% complete; 7 validated SMB use cases from 2026-02-26 transcript ready to seed.

**Implication:** SMB work is correctly sequenced. Once SYSTEM clears, intent template builds on Nate's five-element framework with ROI anchors (20-40% email lift, 2-3x conversion). No premature SMB execution = correct constraint handling.

---

## Decision
**DECISION:** HOLD — Maintain SYSTEM primary through end of day. Do not shift to SMB, UPSKILL, or BRAND execution until model routing achieves 0 mismatches in 2 consecutive runs AND Foundry completes 2/2 validation runs at ≥95% success.

**Why:** ActiveContext explicitly prioritizes reliability removal before capability compounding. Premature context-switching to SMB or BRAND would violate the constraint-ordered priority stack and risk building on unstable infrastructure.

## Top 3 Next Actions

1. **Verify SYSTEM Fix Deployment (SYSTEM) — Evening Check**
   - Confirm `radar-daily-scan` config has explicit `payload.model = "ollama/qwen2.5:7b"` pinning
   - Trigger 2 Foundry runs; verify success rate against ≥95% target
   - Decision: If 0 mismatches + 2/2 Foundry success → unblock all tracks for weekend. If not → manual `openclaw.json` review.

2. **Ship Intent Layer Template (SMB) — Weekend (Conditional)**
   - Build `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md` with 5 sections: Primary Outcome Metric, Secondary Efficiency Metric, Trade-off Rule, Escalation Trigger, Rollback Condition
   - Seed with email personalization example (20-40% revenue lift anchor)
   - Gate: Verify template works for 2+ of 7 validated SMB use cases from 2026-02-26 transcript

3. **Execute Under-Served Track Actions (LIFE/BRAND) — Weekend (Parallel)**
   - LIFE: Draft `memory/planning-protocol.md` (morning priority → shift handoff → evening execution)
   - BRAND: Add Foundry reliability case study outline to `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` (use 67% → 95% metric narrative)
   - Both are time-boxed 20 min each; ship partial if blocked, document blockers

## Risk + Mitigation

**Risk:** Warehouse shift tonight blocks evening execution; weekend build cycle misses opportunity window.
**Mitigation:** Prepare async handoff with explicit priority stack: SYSTEM validation → SMB template → LIFE/BRAND quick wins. If Cobi has 30 min this weekend, top priority is verifying routing fix, not building new assets.

---

## One-Line Focus
Verify SYSTEM fixes by evening or trigger manual escalation — infrastructure stability gates all other progress.

## Track Balance Check
- **Yesterday:** SYSTEM (justified: routing drift)
- **Today:** SYSTEM (justified: drift unresolved, Foundry unvalidated)
- **Tomorrow/Weekend:** Force UPSKILL or BRAND primary if SYSTEM clears; else continue SYSTEM until resolved.

**Under-Served Track Status:** LIFE (no substantive output 48h+ per 2026-02-26 synthesis), BRAND (content backlog has outlines, no shipped threads this week). Both queued for weekend execution contingent on SYSTEM validation.
