# Source Adaptation Analysis — Frontier Operations Pattern

## Source Analyzed
**Video:** https://youtu.be/RnjgLlQTMf0  
**Title:** "The Most Valuable Skill in the Age of AI — Frontier Operations"  
**Type:** Framework/Theory with Practical Application  
**Value Rating:** P0 (Highest)

## Pattern Extraction: What Made This High-Value

### 1. Named Concept
- Creates new vocabulary: "Frontier Operations"
- Memorable, shareable, positionable
- Can be claimed/associated with

### 2. Structured Framework
- 5 clear components (boundary sensing, seam design, failure models, capability forecasting, leverage calibration)
- Each has definition, examples, bad patterns
- Complete mental model

### 3. Multi-Domain Examples
- Product management
- Marketing
- Engineering
- Legal
- Consulting
- Customer success
- Applies across industries

### 4. Practical Application
- Not just theory
- Specific actions for individuals, managers, leaders
- Hiring signals
- Team structures

### 5. Business/Entrepreneurial Angle
- Consulting framework potential
- Training program structure
- Assessment rubric
- Revenue-generating IP

### 6. Timing/Relevance
- Addresses current AI moment
- Future-oriented (6-12 month horizon)
- Speaks to immediate anxiety ("what skills do I need?")

## Source Type Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Format** | Long-form video (45 min) |
| **Source Type** | Thought leader/framework creator |
| **Depth** | Deep (structured, comprehensive) |
| **Actionability** | High (specific skills to develop) |
| **MRR Potential** | High (consulting, training, assessment) |
| **Content Goldmine** | Yes (dozens of threads/posts possible) |

## Similar Source Criteria

**Target Sources Should Have:**

1. **Named frameworks** (not generic advice)
2. **Structured components** (3-7 clear parts)
3. **Cross-domain application** (works for multiple roles/industries)
4. **Practical examples** (real scenarios, not theory)
5. **Business/entrepreneurial angle** (can be monetized)
6. **Future-oriented** (addresses where things are going)
7. **Dense content** (45+ min or equivalent depth)
8. **Thought leader/creator** (not news, not surface-level)

**Avoid:**
- News updates (no framework)
- Tool tutorials (too specific)
- Generic "AI is changing work" content
- Surface-level listicles
- Vendor marketing
