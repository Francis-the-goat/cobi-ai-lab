# Daily Plan — 2026-02-25

**Orchestrator:** Strategist (moonshot/kimi-k2.5)  
**Generated:** 2026-02-25 22:22 AEST  
**Primary Track:** SYSTEM (unblocks all other tracks)

---

## Primary Objective

**Fix Foundry Reliability to ≥95%** — The AI Business Asset Foundry is the critical path for converting research into deployable assets. Current 67% success rate blocks all downstream asset production. Today's focus is validating the active experiment (exp-2026-02-25-27403) and fixing model routing drift.

## Track Objectives

### SMB — Buyer Validation Sprint
**Objective:** Complete first 3 real buyer conversations by end of week.  
**Status:** BLOCKED — zero conversations completed.  
**Action:** Draft outreach templates for warehouse-era schedule constraints.

### UPSKILL — Agentic Architecture Mastery
**Objective:** Complete OpenAI Agents SDK deep-dive from harvested sources.  
**Action:** Watch "Intro to Agent Builder" (OpenAI official, score=8) and extract implementation patterns for Foundry v2.

### BRAND — Content Evidence Pipeline
**Objective:** Document Foundry fix process for first technical thread.  
**Action:** Capture before/after metrics, error patterns, and solution for X thread material.

### LIFE — Daily Planning Protocol
**Objective:** Complete one-page daily planning protocol.  
**Action:** Draft protocol integrating warehouse shift constraints and agent handoffs.

### SYSTEM — Model Routing + Foundry Reliability
**Objective:** Eliminate model mismatches (4 instances) and validate foundry fix.  
**Action:** Pin explicit model in payloads + add pre-flight validation checklist.

## Delegation Tasks for Specialists

### 1. Resource Harvester (Local Worker)
**Assigned:** Evening batch (22:30 AEST)  
**Task:** 
- Run `bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/value_resource_harvest.sh 3`
- Queue top 3 scored items for transcription
- Create `memory/research/2026-02-26-resource-harvest.md`

### 2. Insight Synthesizer (Analyst)
**Assigned:** Morning (06:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Review harvested sources from Resource Harvester
- Watch and distill OpenAI "Intro to Agent Builder" (priority)
- Update `memory/2026-02-26.md` with decisions and next actions
- Map transferable frameworks to SMB use cases

### 3. Asset Builder (Builder)
**Assigned:** Post-validation (upon foundry reliability fix)  
**Task:**
- Build YouTube transcription skill using OpenAI Agents SDK patterns
- Target: `asset-foundry/2026-02-26-youtube-transcribe-skill/`
- Include: transcription pipeline + summarization + style extraction

### 4. Content Funnel (Brand Operator)
**Assigned:** Evening (21:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Draft X thread documenting Foundry reliability fix
- Include: before/after metrics, specific error patterns, solution approach
- Update `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` with draft

### 5. End-of-Shift Handoff (Operator)
**Assigned:** Pre-warehouse shift (08:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Summarize completed work vs plan
- Identify tonight's 3 execution items for Cobi
- Use `DAILY_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` + `OUTPUT_STANDARD.md`

---

## Quality Gates

1. **Evidence Required:**
   - Foundry success rate metric (target: ≥95%)
   - Model mismatch count (target: 0)
   - Resource harvest count (target: 20 videos, 3 queued)

2. **Business-First Gate:**
   - If foundry reliability not fixed by 12:00 AEST, escalate to manual intervention
   - No new framework building until foundry is stable

3. **Track Balance Check:**
   - Last 24h: 80% SYSTEM, 10% UPSKILL, 10% other
   - Next 24h target: 40% SYSTEM, 25% SMB, 20% BRAND, 15% LIFE

## Risk Flags

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Foundry fix fails | HIGH | Manual fallback + Codex direct intervention |
| Model routing persists | HIGH | Pin all payloads explicitly, add health checks |
| Harvester yt-dlp fails | MEDIUM | API fallback for transcription queue |
| Cobi warehouse schedule blocks execution | MEDIUM | Async handoff with clear priority list |

---

## One-Line Focus

Fix Foundry reliability to ≥95%, validate model routing fix, and prepare SMB outreach templates for tomorrow's buyer validation sprint.

---

## Blocked Items

| Item | Blocked By | Unblock Path |
|------|------------|--------------|
| YouTube skill build | Foundry reliability | Fix foundry first, then delegate |
| SMB outreach execution | No templates drafted | Draft templates today, execute tomorrow |
| First buyer conversations | No outreach sent | Templates → targets → send |
