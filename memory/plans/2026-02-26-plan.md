# Daily Plan — 2026-02-26 (Evening Revision)

**Orchestrator:** Strategist (moonshot/kimi-k2.5)  
**Generated:** 2026-02-25 22:37 AEST  
**Primary Track:** SYSTEM (forced non-SMB per track-balance rule)  

---

## Primary Objective

**Fix Model Routing Drift + Validate Foundry Reliability** — 4 model mismatches in 7 days and 67% Foundry success rate are blocking all asset production. Today's non-negotiable: eliminate routing mismatches and validate exp-2026-02-25-27403 with 2+ successful runs. Without reliable infrastructure, SMB and BRAND tracks cannot execute.

---

## Track Objectives

### SYSTEM — Infrastructure Hardening (PRIMARY)
**Objective:** Eliminate model routing mismatches and validate Foundry reliability fix.  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL — 4 mismatches detected, 67% Foundry success blocks all builds.  
**Evidence:** Self-improvement ledger (2026-02-25.md) shows `radar-daily-scan` routing to wrong model; exp-2026-02-25-27403 activated but 0 post-activation runs.  
**Actions:**
1. Pin explicit `payload.model = "ollama/qwen2.5:7b"` in all cron payloads + add provider health check
2. Trigger 2 foundry runs and verify success rate ≥95%
3. If routing persists, escalate to manual openclaw.json config review

**Decision:** BUILD NOW — Infrastructure fixes unlock all downstream tracks.

### UPSKILL — Voice Agent Architecture Completion
**Objective:** Complete voice intake flow drill and identify first integration target.  
**Evidence:** Previous handoff flagged voice agents as highest-leverage SMB wedge; drill started but incomplete.  
**Actions:**
1. Complete 3-step voice intake flow sketch (dental practice scenario)
2. Document 1 blocking integration point (practice management API)
3. Write 1 ROI paragraph for dentist audience

**Artifact:** `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-02-26.md`

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Voice agents are the highest-leverage wedge per PROJECTS.md.

### BRAND — Foundry Reliability Case Study
**Objective:** Draft first technical X thread from real system fix (not generic advice).  
**Evidence:** Self-improvement ledger provides concrete before/after: 67% → 95% target, exp-2026-02-25-27403.  
**Actions:**
1. Screenshot/log Foundry metrics before/after
2. Draft thread: "How I fixed a 67% success rate in my AI asset pipeline"
3. Include: specific error patterns, fix hypothesis, validation method

**Artifact:** Update `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` with thread outline + evidence links

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Document real builds, not commentary.

### SMB — Buyer Validation (HOLD)
**Objective:** Maintain outreach momentum without being primary.  
**Evidence:** 0/3 conversations completed this week per previous plan — but infrastructure must come first.  
**Actions:**
1. Send 1 follow-up to warm lead from previous outreach (if any)
2. Queue 2 new targets for tomorrow if SYSTEM objectives hit
3. Document any responses in `memory/2026-02-26.md`

**Decision:** DEFER primary focus — unblock with SYSTEM fixes first.

### LIFE — Daily Planning Protocol
**Objective:** Ship one-page daily planning protocol for warehouse shift days.  
**Evidence:** Personal OS is priority per GOALS.md Month 1; inconsistency flagged in previous reviews.  
**Actions:**
1. Draft protocol: morning priority → shift handoff → evening execution list
2. Include: 3 non-negotiables, async handoff template, review checkpoint
3. Test with tomorrow's (Feb 27) execution

**Artifact:** `memory/planning-protocol.md`

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Consistency multiplier for all other tracks.

## Forced Cross-Track Actions (Non-SMB)

Per AGENTS.md track-balance rule (SMB was primary yesterday), minimum 2 concrete actions outside SMB:

1. **SYSTEM:** Fix model routing + validate Foundry experiment — 2 cron runs with 0 mismatches target
2. **UPSKILL:** Complete voice agent architecture drill — 1 file with flow sketch + ROI paragraph
3. **LIFE:** Ship daily planning protocol — 1 file with tested template

These are non-negotiable even if SYSTEM work expands.

## Delegation Tasks for Specialists

### 1. Resource Harvester (Local Worker)
**Assigned:** Morning batch (post-validation)  
**Task:**
- Run `bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/value_resource_harvest.sh 3`
- Target: 1 voice AI healthcare source, 1 agentic systems operator case study
- Create `memory/research/2026-02-26-resource-harvest.md`
- Queue top 2 for transcription only if Foundry success ≥95%

**Blocked by:** Foundry reliability validation — do not harvest if builds are failing.

### 2. Insight Synthesizer (Analyst)
**Assigned:** Evening (20:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Review voice agent drill output
- Review SYSTEM fix results (routing + Foundry)
- Update `memory/2026-02-26.md` with:
  - Routing fix validation (0 mismatches = success)
  - Foundry experiment status (promote/rollback/hold)
  - Voice agent integration blockers
  - Decisions and next actions per track

### 3. Asset Builder (Builder)
**Assigned:** CONDITIONAL — only if Foundry ≥95% success + model routing fixed  
**Task:**
- Build YouTube transcription skill scaffold
- Target: `asset-foundry/2026-02-26-youtube-transcribe-skill/`
- Include: transcription pipeline + summarization + source card generation
- Use Liam Ottley "Build & Sell AI Automations" or Hormozi AI playbook as test input

**Unblock path:** SYSTEM primary objectives must complete first.

### 4. Content Funnel (Brand Operator)
**Assigned:** Evening (20:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Draft X thread from ONE of:
  - Foundry reliability fix (preferred — real metrics)
  - Voice agent drill output (fallback)
  - SYSTEM routing fix technical deep-dive (if Foundry still blocked)
- Requirements: specific numbers, error logs, fix method
- Update `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md`

### 5. End-of-Shift Handoff (Operator)
**Assigned:** Pre-warehouse shift (07:30 AEST, Feb 27)  
**Task:**
- Summarize completed work vs this plan
- Identify tonight's 3 execution items for Cobi
- Use `DAILY_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` + `OUTPUT_STANDARD.md`
- Flag: SYSTEM fix status (routing + Foundry), voice drill completion

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Target | Evidence Location |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Model mismatches | 0 in next 2 runs | Cron run logs, self-improvement ledger |
| Foundry success rate | ≥95% (2/2 runs) | Self-improvement ledger |
| Voice drill | 1 file created | `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-02-26.md` |
| Planning protocol | 1 file created | `memory/planning-protocol.md` |
| X thread draft | 1 outline in backlog | `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` |

---

## Risk Flags

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Routing fix fails | HIGH | Pin all payloads explicitly; manual config review; escalate to builder lane |
| Foundry stays <95% | HIGH | Manual Codex intervention; delay all asset building; revisit hypothesis |
| Warehouse schedule blocks | MEDIUM | Async handoff with clear priority list; defer non-critical SYSTEM tasks |
| Voice drill incomplete | MEDIUM | Time-box to 20 min; ship partial if blocked; document blockers |

---

## One-Line Focus

Fix model routing and validate Foundry reliability — infrastructure before revenue, or the revenue track has no foundation to execute on.

---

## Blocked Items

| Item | Blocked By | Unblock Path |
|------|------------|--------------|
| YouTube skill build | Foundry <95% OR routing mismatches | Complete SYSTEM primary objectives |
| Heavy resource harvesting | Foundry <95% | Wait for validation; light harvest only |
| Buyer conversation sprint | Infrastructure instability | Complete SYSTEM fixes first |
