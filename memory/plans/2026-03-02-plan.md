# Daily Plan — 2026-03-02 (Monday)

**Orchestrator:** Strategist (moonshot/kimi-k2.5)  
**Generated:** 2026-03-02 06:55 AEST  
**Primary Track:** BRAND (justified: SYSTEM operational per 2026-03-01; forced non-SMB per track-balance rule; content backlog ready for execution)  
**Yesterday's Primary:** SYSTEM (2026-02-27) — now operational

---

## Primary Objective

**Document and Distribute the Value-to-Asset Pipeline** — The SYSTEM infrastructure is operational (Mission Control, Auto-Build, Value Hunter all running). Today's non-negotiable: convert this real build into distribution assets. Ship 1 X thread documenting the pipeline with specific metrics + 1 Instagram Reel demo of Mission Control.

**Evidence:** 2026-03-01.md confirms pipeline operational; CONTENT_BACKLOG.md has high-priority thread ideas ready; Month 1 GOALS.md milestone requires 20+ X posts and 500 followers.

---

## Track Objectives

### BRAND — Pipeline Documentation Sprint (PRIMARY)
**Objective:** Convert operational SYSTEM build into 2 distribution assets (X thread + Reel).  
**Status:** 🟡 CRITICAL — Real work exists, distribution is bottleneck; Month 1 milestone at risk without execution.  
**Evidence:** CONTENT_BACKLOG.md has 4 high-priority thread ideas; 2026-03-01.md has concrete pipeline metrics to cite.

**Actions:**
1. **X Thread:** "I built an autonomous AI asset pipeline — here's the architecture" 
   - Hook: 5AM harvest → Value Hunter → Auto-Build → Mission Control
   - Metrics: Models routed (local/premium), cost savings %, assets built count
   - Architecture diagram (text-based) showing the 4-stage flow
   - CTA: Which stage would you build first?
2. **Instagram Reel:** Screen recording of Mission Control dashboard
   - 15-30 second demo showing live pipeline status
   - Caption: "My AI agents build AI agents while I'm at work"
   - Post to both Instagram and X as video
3. **Content Log:** Update CONTENT_BACKLOG.md with published URLs/timestamps

**Artifacts:** 
- X thread draft in `memory/content/2026-03-02-pipeline-thread.md`
- Reel uploaded to Instagram + cross-posted to X
- Updated CONTENT_BACKLOG.md with "PUBLISHED" status

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Distribution from real work is highest-leverage move given operational SYSTEM.

---

### LIFE — Daily Planning Protocol (Under-Served Track)
**Objective:** Complete and test the daily planning protocol started 2026-02-27.  
**Evidence:** LIFE flagged as under-served in ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md; 2026-02-27 plan drafted but status unknown; GOALS.md Month 1 milestone includes personal OS.

**Actions:**
1. Review `memory/planning-protocol.md` from Feb 27 — if missing, create from scratch
2. Finalize one-page format: morning priority → shift handoff → evening execution list
3. Include: 3 non-negotiables, async handoff template, review checkpoint
4. Test template with today's execution plan

**Artifact:** `memory/planning-protocol.md` (completed and tested)

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Consistency multiplier; closes under-served track gap.

---

### UPSKILL — Voice Agent Integration Map Completion
**Objective:** Close the voice agent drill started 2026-02-27.  
**Evidence:** 2026-02-27 plan flagged voice agents as highest-leverage SMB wedge; drill incomplete per PROJECTS.md; 58% dental automation stat validated from radar scan.

**Actions:**
1. Complete 3-step voice intake flow sketch for dental practice scenario
2. Document 1 blocking integration point (practice management API vs. generic webhook)
3. Write 1 ROI paragraph for dentist audience using 58% automation stat + NHS validation

**Artifact:** `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-03-02.md` (completed)

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Voice agents are validated wedge; close knowledge gap before buyer conversations.

---

### SYSTEM — Skill Reliability Audit (Maintenance)
**Objective:** Run weekly skill contract audit per AUTONOMOUS_WORK_SYSTEM.md.  
**Evidence:** QUALITY_BAR.md requires skill contract gates; last audit date unknown; operational SYSTEM needs reliability validation.

**Actions:**
1. Run: `python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/operator-skill-reliability/scripts/run_skill_checks.py`
2. Review any skills scoring <75% contract coverage
3. Log findings to `memory/reports/2026-03-02-skill-contract-audit.md`

**Artifact:** `memory/reports/2026-03-02-skill-contract-audit.md`

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Maintenance required; low effort, high reliability ROI.

---

### SMB — Intent Layer Template Validation (Background)
**Objective:** Verify SMB intent layer template works for 2+ use cases.  
**Evidence:** `asset-foundry/2026-02-26-smb-intent-layer-template/` created per 2026-02-27 plan; needs validation before client use.

**Actions:**
1. Read existing template from `asset-foundry/2026-02-26-smb-intent-layer-template/`
2. Test against: dental voice intake + home services lead qual scenarios
3. Document gaps or confirm readiness

**Artifact:** Validation notes in template folder README

**Decision:** DEFER — Not primary; complete if BRAND/LIFE/UPSKILL finish early.

---

## Forced Cross-Track Actions (Non-SMB)

Per AUTONOMOUS_WORK_SYSTEM.md track-balance rule (≥2 concrete actions outside SMB):

1. **LIFE:** Complete daily planning protocol — `memory/planning-protocol.md` tested
2. **UPSKILL:** Close voice agent integration map — `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-03-02.md`
3. **SYSTEM:** Run skill reliability audit — `memory/reports/2026-03-02-skill-contract-audit.md`
4. **BRAND:** Ship X thread + Reel — 2 distribution assets from real build

These are non-negotiable.

## Delegation Tasks for Specialists

### 1. Resource Harvester (Local Worker)

- Create: `memory/research/2026-03-02-resource-harvest.md`
- Queue top 2 for transcription ONLY if confidence ≥HIGH per signal policy

**Blocked by:** None — SYSTEM operational, proceed normally.

---

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Target | Evidence Location |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| X thread published | 1 thread live | X post URL in 2026-03-02.md |
| Instagram Reel published | 1 reel live | Instagram post URL in 2026-03-02.md |
| Planning protocol | 1 file created + tested | `memory/planning-protocol.md` |
| Voice agent drill | 1 file completed | `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-03-02.md` |
| Skill audit | 1 report created | `memory/reports/2026-03-02-skill-contract-audit.md` |

---

## Risk Flags

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Content creation takes longer than 2h | MEDIUM | Time-box: 45min thread + 30min Reel; ship partial if blocked |
| Voice drill blocked by API knowledge gap | LOW | Document blocker, skip ROI paragraph, flag for weekend deep-dive |
| Planning protocol incomplete | LOW | Ship partial version, test with today's plan, iterate tomorrow |
| Warehouse schedule blocks evening synthesis | MEDIUM | Async handoff with clear priority list; synthesizer runs regardless |

---

## One-Line Focus

Document the operational pipeline with an X thread + Reel — convert SYSTEM build into distribution assets while the iron is hot.

---

## Blocked Items

| Item | Blocked By | Unblock Path |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Heavy asset building | BRAND primary incomplete | Complete content sprint first |
| SMB buyer outreach | Intent layer validation pending | Complete template validation (DEFERred task) |
| New skill scaffolding | Voice drill incomplete | Close UPSKILL objective first |

---

## Track Balance Note

- **Last Primary:** SYSTEM (2026-02-27)
- **Today:** BRAND (forced non-SMB per track-balance rule)
- **Tomorrow:** If BRAND completes, consider LIFE or UPSKILL primary; force SMB only if client blocker emerges

*Plan generated by Orchestrator. SYSTEM was primary last cycle — track-balance satisfied with BRAND primary.*
