# Daily Plan — 2026-02-27 (Friday)

**Orchestrator:** Strategist (moonshot/kimi-k2.5)  
**Generated:** 2026-02-27 06:55 AEST  
**Primary Track:** SYSTEM (justified: active reliability blockers — model routing drift unresolved, Foundry experiment awaiting validation)  
**Yesterday's Primary:** SYSTEM (2026-02-26)

---

## Primary Objective

**Close Model Routing Drift + Validate Foundry Experiment exp-2026-02-25-27403** — 4 model mismatches in 5 runs and 0 post-activation experiment runs are blocking all asset production. Today's non-negotiable: achieve 0 routing mismatches and 2+ successful Foundry runs to unblock the weekend build cycle.

**Evidence:** Self-improvement ledger (2026-02-25.md) shows 80% drift rate on `radar-daily-scan`; exp-2026-02-25-27403 status is 🟡 ACTIVATED but 0 validation runs. Synthesis (2026-02-26.md) confirmed these remain unaddressed.

---

## Track Objectives

### SYSTEM — Reliability Validation (PRIMARY)
**Objective:** Eliminate model routing mismatches and validate Foundry experiment with concrete runs.  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL — Drift blocking cost optimization; Foundry reliability gating all builds.  
**Evidence:** 4 model mismatches (config: ollama/qwen2.5:7b → actual: moonshot/kimi-k2.5); Foundry at 67% success with no post-activation data.

**Actions:**
1. **Routing Fix:** Verify `payload.model = "ollama/qwen2.5:7b"` is explicitly pinned in `radar-daily-scan` config; add pre-run Ollama health check
2. **Foundry Validation:** Trigger 2 `foundry-daily-build-candidate` runs; measure success rate against ≥95% target
3. **Decision Gate:** If routing persists after fix → escalate to manual openclaw.json review; if Foundry <95% → delay all asset building

**Artifact:** Updated `memory/2026-02-27.md` with validation results (0 mismatches target, 2/2 Foundry successes)

**Decision:** BUILD NOW — Infrastructure reliability is the constraint on all other tracks.

---

### SMB — Intent Layer Template Prototype
**Objective:** Build reusable "SMB Agent Intent Layer Template" per 2026-02-26 synthesis decision.  
**Evidence:** Synthesis identified Nate's five-element intent framework as competitive differentiator; SMB AI tools transcript provided ROI anchors (20-40% email revenue lift, 2-3x conversion improvement).

**Actions:**
1. Create `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md` with five required sections:
   - Primary Outcome Metric (business result)
   - Secondary Efficiency Metric (time/cost save)
   - Trade-off Rule (what to sacrifice for primary metric)
   - Escalation Trigger (when to involve human)
   - Rollback Condition (when to undo)
2. Seed template with email personalization example using 20-40% revenue lift anchor
3. Verify template works for at least 2 of 7 validated SMB use cases from transcript

**Artifact:** `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md`

**Decision:** PROTOTYPE — Encode intent engineering framework into reusable client deliverable.

---

### UPSKILL — Voice Agent Integration Map
**Objective:** Complete voice intake flow drill and identify first integration target.  
**Evidence:** 2026-02-26 plan flagged voice agents as highest-leverage SMB wedge; drill started but incomplete per PROJECTS.md.

**Actions:**
1. Complete 3-step voice intake flow sketch for dental practice scenario
2. Document 1 blocking integration point (practice management API vs. generic webhook)
3. Write 1 ROI paragraph for dentist audience using 58% automation stat + NHS validation

**Artifact:** `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-02-27.md`

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Voice agents are the validated wedge; close the knowledge gap.

---

### BRAND — Foundry Reliability Case Study Draft
**Objective:** Draft X thread from real system fix (not generic advice).  
**Evidence:** Self-improvement ledger provides concrete before/after: 67% → 95% target; exp-2026-02-25-27403 provides experimental narrative.

**Actions:**
1. Screenshot/log Foundry metrics before/after (use 2026-02-25.md ledger data)
2. Draft thread outline in `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md`: "How I fixed a 67% success rate in my AI asset pipeline"
3. Include: specific error patterns (model routing drift), fix hypothesis, validation method

**Artifact:** Updated `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` with thread outline + evidence links

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Document real builds with metrics; establish credibility through transparency.

---

### LIFE — Daily Planning Protocol (Under-Served Track)
**Objective:** Ship one-page daily planning protocol for warehouse shift days.  
**Evidence:** LIFE flagged as under-served (no substantive output in 48h per 2026-02-26 synthesis); GOALS.md Month 1 milestone includes personal OS.

**Actions:**
1. Draft `memory/planning-protocol.md`: morning priority → shift handoff → evening execution list
2. Include: 3 non-negotiables, async handoff template, review checkpoint
3. Test template with tonight's (Feb 27) execution plan

**Artifact:** `memory/planning-protocol.md`

**Decision:** EXECUTE NOW — Consistency multiplier for split-attention constraint; closes under-served track gap.

---

## Forced Cross-Track Actions (Non-SMB)

Per AUTONOMOUS_WORK_SYSTEM.md track-balance rule (ensure at least 2 concrete actions outside SMB):

1. **SYSTEM:** Fix model routing + validate Foundry experiment — target 0 mismatches, 2/2 Foundry successes
2. **UPSKILL:** Complete voice agent integration map — 1 file with flow sketch + ROI paragraph
3. **LIFE:** Ship daily planning protocol — 1 file with tested template
4. **BRAND:** Draft Foundry reliability case study — 1 thread outline in backlog

These are non-negotiable even if SYSTEM work expands.

## Delegation Tasks for Specialists

### 1. Resource Harvester (Local Worker)
**Assigned:** Morning batch (09:00 AEST, post-SYSTEM validation)  
**Task:**
- Run `bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/value_resource_harvest.sh 3`
- Target: 1 voice AI healthcare integration case study, 1 agentic systems operator technical post
- Create `memory/research/2026-02-27-resource-harvest.md`
- Queue top 2 for transcription ONLY if Foundry success ≥95% and routing mismatches = 0

**Blocked by:** SYSTEM validation — do not harvest if builds are failing or routing is drifting.

---

### 2. Insight Synthesizer (Analyst)
**Assigned:** Evening (20:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Review SYSTEM fix results (routing + Foundry)
- Review SMB intent layer template output
- Review voice agent drill completion
- Update `memory/2026-02-27.md` with:
  - Routing fix validation (0 mismatches = success)
  - Foundry experiment status (promote/rollback/hold with evidence)
  - Voice agent integration blockers
  - Decisions and next actions per track

---

### 3. Asset Builder (Builder)
**Assigned:** CONDITIONAL — only if Foundry ≥95% success + model routing fixed  
**Task:**
- Build YouTube transcription skill scaffold
- Target: `asset-foundry/2026-02-27-youtube-transcribe-skill/`
- Include: transcription pipeline + summarization + source card generation
- Use Liam Ottley "Build & Sell AI Automations" as test input

**Unblock path:** SYSTEM primary objectives must complete first; this is the weekend build target if Friday validation succeeds.

---

### 4. Content Funnel (Brand Operator)
**Assigned:** Evening (20:00 AEST)  
**Task:**
- Draft X thread from ONE of:
  - Foundry reliability fix (preferred — real metrics from ledger)
  - Voice agent drill output (fallback)
  - Intent layer template explanation (if Foundry still blocked)
- Requirements: specific numbers, error logs or framework elements, clear takeaway
- Update `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` with draft

---

### 5. End-of-Shift Handoff (Operator)
**Assigned:** Pre-warehouse shift (07:30 AEST, Feb 28)  
**Task:**
- Summarize completed work vs this plan
- Identify tonight's 3 execution items for Cobi
- Use `DAILY_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` + `OUTPUT_STANDARD.md`
- Flag: SYSTEM fix status (routing + Foundry), voice drill completion, intent template status

---

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Target | Evidence Location |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Model mismatches | 0 in next 2 runs | Cron run logs, self-improvement ledger |
| Foundry success rate | ≥95% (2/2 runs) | Self-improvement ledger |
| Intent layer template | 1 file created | `asset-foundry/templates/smb-intent-layer.md` |
| Voice drill | 1 file created | `memory/voice-agent-drill-2026-02-27.md` |
| Planning protocol | 1 file created | `memory/planning-protocol.md` |
| X thread draft | 1 outline in backlog | `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` |

---

## Risk Flags

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Routing fix fails again | HIGH | Manual openclaw.json config review; escalate to builder lane with explicit model pinning |
| Foundry stays <95% | HIGH | Delay all asset building; manual Codex intervention; revisit experiment hypothesis |
| Warehouse schedule blocks evening work | MEDIUM | Async handoff with clear priority list; defer non-critical tasks to weekend |
| Voice drill or intent template incomplete | MEDIUM | Time-box to 20 min each; ship partial if blocked; document blockers for weekend |

---

## One-Line Focus

Fix model routing drift and validate Foundry reliability — close the infrastructure blockers before weekend so asset building can resume.

---

## Blocked Items

| Item | Blocked By | Unblock Path |
|------|------------|--------------|
| YouTube skill build | Foundry <95% OR routing mismatches | Complete SYSTEM primary objectives |
| Heavy resource harvesting | Foundry <95% | Wait for validation; light harvest only |
| Buyer conversation sprint | Infrastructure instability | Complete SYSTEM fixes first |

---

## Track Balance Note

- **Yesterday:** SYSTEM (non-SMB per forced track-balance rule)
- **Today:** SYSTEM (justified by active blockers — routing drift and Foundry validation unresolved)
- **Tomorrow/Weekend:** Force UPSKILL or BRAND primary unless new blocker emerges

*Plan generated by Orchestrator. SMB was NOT primary yesterday (SYSTEM was) — track-balance satisfied but reliability blockers justify continued SYSTEM focus.*
