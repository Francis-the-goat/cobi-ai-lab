# Security Hardening Session - 2026-02-24

## Actions Taken

### 1. Enabled Sandboxing for All Sessions
- Added `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode = "all"` to openclaw.json
- Small models (llama3.2:3b, deepseek-coder:1.3b) now run sandboxed
- Web tools disabled for small models (safer fallback behavior)

### 2. Updated OpenClaw
- Updated from 2026.2.22-2 to 2026.2.23
- Completed successfully in 41.74s

### 3. Attempted Auto-Update Enablement
- Requires sudo access (manual step needed)

## Verification Results

**Before:**
- 1 CRITICAL: Small models unsandboxed with web access
- 1 WARN: Trusted proxies
- 1 INFO: Attack surface summary

**After:**
- 0 CRITICAL ✓
- 1 WARN: Trusted proxies (expected for localhost-only)
- 2 INFO: Attack surface, small models (now sandboxed)

## Current Posture

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| OpenClaw Version | 2026.2.23 (current) |
| Gateway Bind | Loopback only (127.0.0.1:18789) |
| Small Model Sandboxing | Enabled ✓ |
| Web Tools for Small Models | Disabled ✓ |
| FileVault | ON ✓ |
| macOS Firewall | ON ✓ |
| Time Machine | Configured |

## Remaining Item

**macOS Automatic Security Updates**
Needs manual run:
```bash
sudo softwareupdate --schedule on
```

Enter your Mac password when prompted.

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Read-only reconnaissance
openclaw security audit --deep
openclaw update status
sw_vers
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
tmutil status
fdesetup status
openclaw status --deep

# Changes made
# Edited ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json - added sandbox.mode = "all"
openclaw update
openclaw security audit  # verification
```

## Risk Profile: Home/Workstation Balanced

- Local-only OpenClaw access (safe)
- Sandboxed small models (safe)
- Full disk encryption enabled
- Firewall enabled
- Auto-updates pending manual enable

## Next Review

Recommended: Weekly heartbeat checks, monthly deep audit
