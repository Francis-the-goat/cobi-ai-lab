# Style Profile

This file captures what Cobi wants in high-quality outputs.
Update only when repeated source patterns are validated.

## Preferred Output Traits
- Business-first and execution-oriented
- Concrete metrics and economic logic
- Strong opinions with clear reasoning
- Practical next actions over abstract advice

## Disliked Traits
- Generic beginner guidance
- Filler language and hype
- Long summaries without decisions

## Trusted Patterns To Reuse
- Use hooks tied to market timing or economic urgency
- Use contrarian framing: "AI failed at the wrong objective, not the task"
- Translate capability -> target workflow -> KPI movement
- End with one decisive next action

## Voice Constraints
- Direct, concise, no fluff
- Confident but not overclaiming
- Explain assumptions when evidence is weak
