# Cobi AI Lab

Agentic systems, AI tools, and personal growth experiments.

**Mission:** Exit 9-5 within 12 months through AI-powered leverage.

## Operating Tracks

This workspace runs as a multi-track system:
1. `SMB` — Build agentic systems that increase business throughput and quality.
2. `UPSKILL` — Compound AI/business capability through applied work.
3. `BRAND` — Convert real execution into authority content.
4. `LIFE` — Build personal systems for consistency and focus.
5. `SYSTEM` — Continuously improve agent architecture and automation.

## What's Here

### Foundation
- `SOUL.md` — Agent identity and operating principles
- `USER.md` — Cobi's profile and context
- `PROJECTS.md` — Active projects and status
- `GOALS.md` — 12-month roadmap with milestones

### Operations
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — Autonomous task queue for warehouse hours
- `CONTENT_BACKLOG.md` — X/Instagram content ideas and drafts
- `SKILLS.md` — Workflow library and patterns
- `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_SYSTEM.md` — Orchestrator + specialist role contract
- `LEVERAGE_OS.md` — System for converting AI trajectory into SMB assets
- `SCRAPLING_INTEGRATION.md` — Web-intelligence extraction and monitoring setup
- `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_OS.md` — Closed-loop optimization system (metrics -> experiments -> upgrades)

### Architecture
- `MODEL_ROUTING.md` — Multi-model orchestration (Local + Kimi)
- `MODEL_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Execution-first lane assignments and premium allowlist
- `AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` — Canonical operating architecture (Codex design + OpenClaw execution)
- `TASK_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md` — Required contract for autonomous execution tasks
- `codex-integration.md` — Codex CLI setup and usage
- `skills/` — Custom OpenClaw skills

### Automation
- `scripts/install_leverage_crons.sh` — Installs/updates leverage cron suite
- `scripts/leverage_setup_audit.sh` — Verifies profile/workspace/model/auth alignment
- `scripts/self_improvement_cycle.sh` — Generates daily optimization report from cron run data
- `scripts/value_resource_harvest.sh` — Collects high-signal videos/news and queues transcription
- `scripts/source_adapt_recommend.py` — Learns from ingested sources and recommends aligned next sources
- `scripts/add_source_and_recommend.sh` — One command to ingest a source and trigger recommendation loop
- `scripts/agent_quality_audit.py` — Weekly scoring of cron reliability, output quality, and fix priorities
- `config/source_preferences.json` — Preferred creators + official docs weighting for recommendation quality

## Stack

- **OpenClaw** — Agent orchestration (24/7 on Mac Mini)
- **Multi-Model Routing** — Local (Llama 3.2), LocalCode (DeepSeek), Kimi (K2.5)
- **Codex** — Advanced coding and architecture
- **GitHub** — Continuous asset shipping

## Current Focus

Building an agency around agentic systems for SMBs while compounding upskill, personal brand, life systems, and agent performance.

**Status:** Month 1, Foundation Phase

## Hands-Free Input

You should not need to run scripts manually.
When you share source links or creator references in chat, the agent is expected to ingest/analyze/recommend automatically.
