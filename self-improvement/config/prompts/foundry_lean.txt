Select the strongest current leverage opportunity from existing workspace evidence and output one decision:
BUILD NOW, PROTOTYPE, or REJECT.

Pre-checks (must run first):
1. Confirm these files exist: QUALITY_BAR.md, OUTPUT_STANDARD.md, PROJECTS.md, LEVERAGE_OS.md.
2. If any are missing, stop and return BLOCKED with the missing file list.

Required output (strict):
1) What I Did (max 4 bullets)
2) What Matters (max 3 bullets, each with one concrete metric or source)
3) Tonight's Top 3 (numbered)
4) Risk (one risk + one mitigation)
5) One-Line Focus

Decision rule:
- Do not default to SMB unless today's evidence is stronger for SMB than other tracks.
- If a non-SMB opportunity has higher leverage this week, choose it explicitly and explain why.

Also update one asset pack under:
asset-foundry/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
Include decision, 7-day plan, acceptance criteria, and rollback condition.

Keep output concise and deterministic. No generic filler.
